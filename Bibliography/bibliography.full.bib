With the 2-fold aim of addressing this problem and clarifying pancrustacean relationships, we explored the signals in the 62 protein-coding genes carefully assembled by Regier et al. in 2010. With reference to the pancrustaceans, this data set infers a highly supported nucleotide tree that is substantially different to the corresponding, but poorly supported, amino acid one. We show that the discrepancy between the nucleotide-based and the amino acids-based trees is caused by substitutions within synonymous codon families (especially those of serine-TCN and AGY). We show that different arthropod lineages are differentially biased in their usage of serine, arginine, and leucine synonymous codons, and that the serine bias is correlated with the topology derived from the nucleotides, but not the amino acids. We suggest that a parallel, partially compositionally driven, synonymous codon-usage bias affects the nucleotide topology. As substitutions between serine codon families can proceed through threonine or cysteine intermediates, amino acid data sets might also be affected by the serine codon-usage bias. We suggest that a Dayhoff recoding strategy would partially ameliorate the effects of such bias. Although amino acids provide an alternative hypothesis of pancrustacean relationships, neither the nucleotides nor the amino acids version of this data set seems to bring enough genuine phylogenetic information to robustly resolve the relationships within group, which should still be considered unresolved.},

    abstract = {Background: A mechanistic codon substitution model, in which each codon substitution rate is proportional to the product of a codon mutation rate and the average fixation probability depending on the type of amino acid replacement, has advantages over nucleotide, amino acid, and empirical codon substitution models in evolutionary analysis of protein-coding sequences. It can approximate a wide range of codon substitution processes. If no selection pressure on amino acids is taken into account, it will become equivalent to a nucleotide substitution model. If mutation rates are assumed not to depend on the codon type, then it will become essentially equivalent to an amino acid substitution model. Mutation at the nucleotide level and selection at the amino acid level can be separately evaluated.\\
Results:The present scheme for single nucleotide mutations is equivalent to the general time-reversible model, but multiple nucleotide changes in infinitesimal time are allowed. Selective constraints on the respective types of amino acid replacements are tailored to each gene in a linear function of a given estimate of selective constraints. Their good estimates are those calculated by maximizing the respective likelihoods of empirical amino acid or codon substitution frequency matrices. Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicate that the present model performs far better than the other substitution models for all five phylogenetic trees of highly-divergent to highly-homologous sequences of chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear genes. It is also shown that multiple nucleotide changes in infinitesimal time are significant in long branches, although they may be caused by compensatory substitutions or other mechanisms. The variation of selective constraint over sites fits the datasets significantly better than variable mutation rates, except for 10 slow-evolving nuclear genes of 10 mammals. An critical finding for phylogenetic analysis is that assuming variable mutation rates over sites lead to the overestimation of branch lengths.</p>        </sec>},

abstract ={Standard protein phylogenetic models use fixed rate matrices of amino acid interchange derived from analyses of large databases. Differences between the stationary amino acid frequencies of these rate matrices from those of a data set of interest are typically adjusted for by matrix multiplication that converts the empirical rate matrix to an exchangeability matrix which is then postmultiplied by the amino acid frequencies in the alignment. The result is a time-reversible rate matrix with stationary amino acid frequencies equal to the data set frequencies. On the basis of population genetics principles, we develop an amino acid substitution-selection model that parameterizes the fitness of an amino acid as the logarithm of the ratio of the frequency of the amino acid to the frequency of the same amino acid under no selection. The model gives rise to a different sequence of matrix multiplications to convert an empirical rate matrix to one that has stationary amino acid frequencies equal to the data set frequencies. We incorporated the substitution-selection model with an improved amino acid class frequency mixture (cF) model to partially take into account site-specific amino acid frequencies in the phylogenetic models. We show that 1) the selection models fit data significantly better than corresponding models without selection for most of the 21 test data sets; 2) both cF and cF selection models favored the phylogenetic trees that were inferred under current sophisticated models and methods for three difficult phylogenetic problems (the positions of microsporidia and breviates in eukaryote phylogeny and the position of the root of the angiosperm tree); and 3) for data simulated under site-specific residue frequencies, the cF selection models estimated trees closer to the generating trees than a standard Ð“ model or cF without selection. We also explored several ways of estimating amino acid frequencies under neutral evolution that are required for these selection models. By better modeling the amino acid substitution process, the cF selection models will be valuable for phylogenetic inference and evolutionary studies.},

abstract={
An adjustable fitness model for amino acid site substitutions is investigated. This model, a generalization of previously developed evolutionary models, has several distinguishing characteristics: it separately accounts for the processes of mutation and substitution, allows for heterogeneity among substitution rates and among evolutionary constraints, and does not make any prior assumptions about which sites or characteristics of proteins are important to molecular evolution. While the model has fewer adjustable parameters than the general reversible mtREV model, when optimized it outperforms mtREV in likelihood analysis on protein-coding mitochondrial genes. In addition, the optimized fitness parameters of the model show correspondence to some biophysical characteristics of amino acids. }

abstract ={Probabilistic inference of a phylogenetic tree from molecular sequence data is predicated on a substitution model describing the relative rates of change between character states along the tree for each site in the multiple sequence alignment. Commonly, one assumes that the substitution model is homogeneous across sites within large partitions of the alignment, assigns these partitions a priori, and then fixes their underlying substitution model to the best-fitting model from a hierarchy of named models. Here, we introduce an automatic model selection and model averaging approach within a Bayesian framework that simultaneously estimates the number of partitions, the assignment of sites to partitions, the substitution model for each partition, and the uncertainty in these selections. This new approach is implemented as an add-on to the BEAST 2 software platform. We find that this approach dramatically improves the fit of the nucleotide substitution model compared with existing approaches, and we show, using a number of example data sets, that as many as nine partitions are required to explain the heterogeneity in nucleotide substitution process across sites in a single gene analysis. In some instances, this improved modeling of the substitution process can have a measurable effect on downstream inference, including the estimated phylogeny, relative divergence times, and effective population size histories.},

Characterizing properties of the data that are not being correctly handled by current models is therefore of prime importance. One of the properties of protein evolution is the variation of the relative rate of substitutions across sites and over time, the latter is the phenomenon called heterotachy. Its effect on phylogenetic inference has recently obtained considerable attention, which led to the development of new models of sequence evolution. However, thus far focus has been on the quantitative heterogeneity of the evolutionary process, thereby overlooking more qualitative variations. Results: We studied the importance of variation of the site-specific amino-acid substitution process over time and its possible impact on phylogenetic inference. We used the CAT model to define an infinite mixture of substitution processes characterized by equilibrium frequencies over the twenty amino acids, a useful proxy for qualitatively estimating the evolutionary process. Using two large datasets, we show that qualitative changes in site-specific substitution properties over time occurred significantly. To test whether this unaccounted qualitative variation can lead to an erroneous phylogenetic tree, we analyzed a concatenation of mitochondrial proteins in which Cnidaria and Porifera were erroneously grouped. The progressive removal of the sites with the most heterogeneous CAT profiles across clades led to the recovery of the monophyly of Eumetazoa (Cnidaria+Bilateria), suggesting that this heterogeneity can negatively influence phylogenetic inference. Conclusion: The time-heterogeneity of the amino-acid replacement process is therefore an important evolutionary aspect that should be incorporated in future models of sequence change.},

Site-specific amino acid distributions can be calculated analytically for this model. We determine optimal parameters for the local interactions by fitting the complete inverse folding model to the site-specific amino acid distributions found in the Protein Data Bank. This procedure reduces drastically the influence on the derived parameters of the preference of different secondary structures for buriedness, which affects local interaction parameters determined through the standard approach based on amino acid propensities. The quality of the fit is evaluated through the likelihood of the observed amino acid distributions given the model and the Bayesian Information Criterion, which indicate that the model with optimal local interaction parameters is strongly preferable to the model where local interaction parameters are determined through propensities. The optimal model yields a mean correlation coefficient r = 0.96 between observed and predicted amino acid distributions. The local interaction parameters are then tested in threading experiments, in combination with contact interactions, for their capacity to recognize the native structure and structures similar to the native against unrelated ones. In a challenging test, proteins structurally aligned with the Mammoth algorithm are scored with the effective free energy function. The native structure gets the highest stability score in 100\% of the cases, a high recognition rate comparable to that achieved against easier decoys generated by gapless threading. We then examine proteins for which at least one highly similar template exists. In 61\% of the cases, the structure with the highest stability score excluding the native belongs to the native fold, compared to 60\% if we use local interaction parameters derived from the usual amino acid propensities and 52\% if we use only contact interactions. A highly similar structure is present within the five best stability scores in 82\%, 81916, and 76\% of the cases, for local interactions determined through inverse folding, through propensity, and set to zero, respectively. These results indicate that local interactions improve substantially the performances of contact free energy functions in fold recognition, and that similar structures tend to get high stability scores, although they are often not high enough to discriminate them from unrelated structures. This work highlights the importance to apply more challenging tests, as the recognition of homologous structures, for testing stability scores for protein folding.},

Unlike previous applications of this model, the groups themselves are estimated from data by simulated annealing. The second model makes substitution rates a function of the physical and chemical similarity between two residues. Because we model the evolution of coding DNA sequences as opposed to protein sequences, artifacts arising from the differing numbers of nucleotide substitutions required to bring about various amino acid substitutions are avoided. Using 10 alignments of related sequences (five of orthologous genes and five gene families), we do find differences in substitution patterns. We also find that, although patterns of amino acid substitution vary temporally within the history of a gene, variation is not greater in paralogous than in orthologous genes. Improved understanding of such gene-specific variation in substitution patterns may have implications for applications such as sequence alignment and phylogenctic inference. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we propose to relax this assumption by developing a Bayesian mixture model that allows the amino-acid replacement pattern at different sites of a protein alignment to be described by distinct substitution processes. Our model, named CAT, assumes the existence of distinct processes (or classes) differing by their equilibrium frequencies over the 20 residues. Through the use of a Dirichlet process prior, the total number of classes and their respective amino-acid profiles, as well as the affiliations of each site to a given class, are all free variables of the model. In this way, the CAT model is able to adapt to the complexity actually present in the data, and it yields an estimate of the substitutional heterogeneity through the posterior mean number of classes. We show that a significant level of heterogeneity is present in the substitution patterns of proteins, and that the standard one-matrix model fails to account for this heterogeneity. By evaluating the Bayes factor, we demonstrate that the standard model is outperformed by CAT on all of the data sets which we analyzed. Altogether, these results suggest that the complexity of the pattern of substitution of real sequences is better captured by the CAT model, offering the possibility of studying its impact on phylogenetic reconstruction and its connections with structure-function determinants.},

With this comparatively realistic framework, an evolutionary rate at a site can depend both on the state of the site and on the states of surrounding sites. By allowing a relatively general dependence structure among sites, models of evolution can reflect attributes of tertiary structure. To quantify the impact of protein structure on protein evolution, we analyze protein-coding DNA sequence pairs with an evolutionary model that incorporates effects of solvent accessibility and pairwise interactions among amino acid residues. By explicitly considering the relationship between nonsynonymous substitution rates and protein structure, this approach can lead to refined detection and characterization of positive selection. Analyses of simulated sequence pairs indicate that parameters in this evolutionary model can be well estimated. Analyses of lysozyme c and annexin V sequence pairs yield the biologically reasonable result that amino acid replacement rates are higher when the replacements lead to energetically favorable proteins than when they destabilize the proteins. Although the focus here is evolutionary dependence among codons that is associated with protein structure, the statistical approach is quite general and could be applied to diverse cases of evolutionary dependence where surrogates for sequence fitness can be measured or modeled.},

In most cases we found the Delta G of transfer from octanol to water to be the best model for evolutionary constraints, in contrast to the much weaker correlation with the Delta G of transfer from cyclohexane to water, a property found to be highly correlated to changes in stability in site-directed mutagenesis studies, This suggests that natural evolution may follow different rules than those suggested by results obtained in the laboratory. A high degree of conservation of a surface residue's relative hydrophobicity was also observed, a fact that cannot be explained by constraints on protein stability but that may reflect the consequences of the reverse-hydrophobic effect. Local propensity, especially or-helical propensity, is rather poorly conserved during evolution, indicating that non-local interactions dominate protein structure formation. We found that changes in volume were important in specific cases, most significantly in transitions among the hydrophobic residues in buried locations. To demonstrate how these techniques could be used to understand particular protein families, we derived and analyzed mutation matrices for the hypervariable and framework regions of antibody light chain V regions. We found a surprisingly high conservation of hydrophobicity in the hypervariable region, possibly indicating an important role for hydrophobicity in antigen recognition. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

"Empirical" models do not explicitly consider factors that shape protein evolution, but attempt to summarize the substitution pattern from large quantities of real data. "Mechanistic" models are formulated at the codon level and separate mutational biases at the nucleotide level from selective constraints at the amino acid level. They account for features of sequence evolution, such as transition-transversion bias and base or codon frequency biases, and make use of physicochemical distances between amino acids to specify nonsynonymous substitution rates. A general approach is presented that transforms a Markov model of codon substitution into a model of amino acid replacement. Protein sequences from the entire mitochondrial genomes of 20 mammalian species were analyzed using different models. The mechanistic models were found to fit the data better than empirical models derived from large databases. Both the mutational distance between amino acids (determined by the genetic code and mutational biases such as the transition-transversion bias) and the physicochemical distance are found to have strong effects on amino acid substitution rates. A significant proportion of amino acid substitutions appeared to have involved more than one codon position, indicating that nucleotide substitutions at neighboring sites may be correlated. Rates of amino acid substitution were found to be highly variable among sites. ER},

Strong support for this model was claimed from a comparative analysis of Neu and genome size for approximate to 30 phylogenetically diverse species ranging from bacteria to vertebrates, but analyses at that scale have so far failed to account for phylogenetic nonindependence of species. In our reanalysis, accounting for phylogenetic history substantially altered the perceived strength of the relationship between Neu and genomic attributes: there were no statistically significant associations between Neu and gene number, intron size, intron number, the half-life of gene duplicates, transposon number, transposons as a fraction of the genome, or overall genome size. We conclude that current datasets do not support the hypothesis of a mechanistic connection between Ne and these genomic attributes, and we suggest that further progress requires larger datasets, phylogenetic comparative methods, more robust estimators of genetic drift, and a multivariate approach that accounts for correlations between putative explanatory variables.},

However, transposable elements (TEs) are a major contributor to genome size evolution, and since they experience their own selective pressures for expansion, genome size changes may in part be driven by the dynamics of co-evolution between TEs and their hosts. Under this perspective, predictions about the conditions that allow for genome expansion may be altered. In this review, we outline the evidence for TE-host co-evolution, discuss the conditions under which these dynamics can change, and explore the possible contribution to the evolution of genome size. Aided partly by advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of TE silencing via small RNAs, there is growing evidence that the evolution of transposition rates can be important in driving genome expansion and contraction. Shifts in genome size and transposon abundance associated with interspecific hybridization and changes in mating system are consistent with an important role for transposition rate evolution, although other possible explanations persist. More understanding of the potential for the breakdown of host silencing mechanisms and/or the potential for TEs to evade host immune responses will improve our understanding of the importance of changes in TE activity in driving genome size evolution.},

We compare the performance of these models on a classic test case for phylogenetic methods, before considering two highly topical questions in evolutionary biology: the deep structure of the tree of life and the root of the archaeal radiation. We show that all three alignments contain meaningful rooting information that can be harnessed by these new models, thus complementing and extending previous work based on outgroup rooting. In particular, our analyses exclude the root of the tree of life from the eukaryotes or Archaea, placing it on the bacterial stem or within the Bacteria. They also exclude the root of the archaeal radiation from several major clades, consistent with analyses using other rooting methods. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of non-reversible and non-stationary models for rooting phylogenetic trees, and identify areas where further progress can be made.},

Here, we report that cultures of Prochlorococcus, a numerically dominant marine cyanobacterium, continuously release lipid vesicles containing proteins, DNA, and RNA. We also show that vesicles carrying DNA from diverse bacteria are abundant in coastal and open-ocean seawater samples. Prochlorococcus vesicles can support the growth of heterotrophic bacterial cultures, which implicates these structures in marine carbon flux. The ability of vesicles to deliver diverse compounds in discrete packages adds another layer of complexity to the flow of information, energy, and biomolecules in marine microbial communities.},

abstract={The functional importance of the roughly 98\% of mammalian genomes not corresponding to protein coding sequences remains largely undetermined1. Here we show that some large-scale deletions of the non-coding DNA referred to as gene deserts2, 3, 4 can be well tolerated by an organism. We deleted two large non-coding intervals, 1,511 kilobases and 845 kilobases in length, from the mouse genome. Viable mice homozygous for the deletions were generated and were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates with regard to morphology, reproductive fitness, growth, longevity and a variety of parameters assaying general homeostasis. Further detailed analysis of the expression of multiple genes bracketing the deletions revealed only minor expression differences in homozygous deletion and wild-type mice. Together, the two deleted segments harbour 1,243 non-coding sequences conserved between humans and rodents (more than 100 base pairs, 70\% identity). Some of the deleted sequences might encode for functions unidentified in our screen; nonetheless, these studies further support the existence of potentially 'disposable DNA' in the genomes of mammals.},

abstract ={The shape of the human face and skull is largely genetically determined. However, the genomic basis of craniofacial morphology is incompletely understood and hypothesized to involve protein-coding genes, as well as gene regulatory sequences. We used a combination of epigenomic profiling, in vivo characterization of candidate enhancer sequences in transgenic mice, and targeted deletion experiments to examine the role of distant-acting enhancers in craniofacial development. We identified complex regulatory landscapes consisting of enhancers that drive spatially complex developmental expression patterns. Analysis of mouse lines in which individual craniofacial enhancers had been deleted revealed significant alterations of craniofacial shape, demonstrating the functional importance of enhancers in defining face and skull morphology. These results demonstrate that enhancers are involved in craniofacial development and suggest that enhancer sequence variation contributes to the diversity of human facial morphology.},

abstract ={A recent slew of ENCODE Consortium publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80\% of the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is under 10\%. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 âˆ’ 10 = 70\% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these â€œfunctionalâ€ regions, or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly (1) by employing the seldom used â€œcausal roleâ€ definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, (2) by committing a logical fallacy known as â€œaffirming the consequent,â€ (3) by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between â€œjunk DNAâ€ and â€œgarbage DNA,â€ (4) by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, (5) by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and (6) by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten.},

Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first, called the ''discrete gamma model,'' uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method, called ''fixed-rates model,'' classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest trees are often found to be zero. The computational requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368-376) model, which assumes a single rate for all the sites.},

We present a robust method to extract codon translation rates and protein synthesis rates from these data, and identify causal features associated with elongation and translation efficiency in physiological conditions in yeast. We show that neither elongation rate nor translational efficiency is improved by experimental manipulation of the abundance or body sequence of the rare AGG tRNA. Deletion of three of the four copies of the heavily used ACA tRNA shows a modest efficiency decrease that could be explained by other rate-reducing signals at gene start. This suggests that correlation between codon bias and efficiency arises as selection for codons to utilize translation machinery efficiently in highly translated genes. We also show a correlation between efficiency and RNA structure calculated both computationally and from recent structure probing data, as well as the Kozak initiation motif, which may comprise a mechanism to regulate initiation.},

The evolutionary selection of codons whose properties are optimal for a cell generates the phenomenon of codon bias. Although recent studies have shown strong effects of codon usage changes on protein expression levels and cellular physiology, no translational control mechanism is known that links codon usage to protein expression levels. Here, we demonstrate a novel translational control mechanism that responds to the speed of ribosome movement immediately after the start codon. High initiation rates are only possible if start codons are liberated sufficiently fast, thus accounting for the observation that fast codons are overrepresented in highly expressed proteins. In contrast, slow codons lead to slow liberation of the start codon by initiating ribosomes, thereby interfering with efficient translation initiation. Codon usage thus evolved as a means to optimise translation on individual mRNAs, as well as global optimisation of ribosome availability.},

Recently, new crystallographic data on full 70S ribosomes with mRNA and tRNAs have shown that the formation of the tight decoding centre is ensured by conformational rearrangement of the 30S subunit (domain closure), which is identical for cognate or near-cognate tRNA. When a GU forms at the first or second codon-anticodon positions (near-cognate tRNA), the ribosomal decoding centre forces the adoption of Watson-Crick GC-like geometry rather than that of the expected Watson-Crick wobble pair. Energy expenditure for rarely occuring tautomeric base required for Watson-Crick GC-like GU pair or the repulsion energy due to steric clash within the mismatched base pair could constitute the only cause for efficient rejection of a near-cognate tRNA. Our data suggest that "geometrical mimicry" can explain how wrong aminoacyl-tRNAs with GU pairs in the codon-anticodon helix forming base pairs with Watson-Crick geometry in the decoding center can be incorporated into the polypeptide chain.

We recently demonstrated that this translational control involves a stress-specific reprogramming of modified ribonucleosides in tRNA.

In yeast exposed to hydrogen peroxide, there is a Trm4 methyltransferase-dependent increase in the proportion of tRNA(Leu((C) under bar AA)) containing m(5)C at the wobble position, which causes selective translation of mRNA from genes enriched in the TTG codon. Of these genes, oxidative stress increases protein expression from the TTG-enriched ribosomal protein gene RPL22A, but not its unenriched paralogue. Loss of either TRM4 or RPL22A confers hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Proteomic analysis reveals that oxidative stress causes a significant translational bias towards proteins coded by TTG-enriched genes. These results point to stress-induced reprogramming of tRNA modifications and consequential reprogramming of ribosomes in translational control of cell survival.},

Upon introduction of heterologous sequences into an organism-for example for the purposes of bioprocessing or synthetic biology-limiting resources may also become overstretched, thus negatively affecting both endogenous and heterologous gene expression. In this study, we present a mean-field model of translation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the investigation of two particular translational resources, namely ribosomes and aminoacylated tRNAs. We firstly use comparisons of experiments with heterologous sequences and simulations of the same conditions to calibrate our model, and then analyse the behaviour of the translational system in yeast upon introduction of different types of heterologous sequences. Our main findings are that: competition for ribosomes, rather than tRNAs, limits global translation in this organism; that tRNA aminoacylation levels exert, at most, weak control over translational activity; and that decoding speeds and codon adaptation exert strong control over local (mRNA specific) translation rates.},

These events ultimately lead to premature termination of translation in response to an initial miscoding error. In this work, we extend our investigations of this mechanism to an in vitro reconstituted Saccharomyces cerevisiae translation system. We report that yeast ribosomes do not respond to mismatches in the P site by loss of fidelity in subsequent substrate recognition events. We conclude that retrospective editing, as initially characterized in Escherichia coli, does not occur in S. cerevisiae.

Failure in speed or accuracy can have dire consequences, including disease in humans. Most estimates of the accuracy come from studies of bacterial systems, principally Escherichia coli, and have involved incomplete analysis of possible errors. We recently used a highly quantitative system to measure the frequency of all types of misreading errors by a single tRNA in E. coli. That study found a wide variation in error frequencies among codons; a major factor causing that variation is competition between the correct (cognate) and incorrect (near-cognate) aminoacyl-tRNAs for the mutant codon. Here we extend that analysis to measure the frequency of missense errors by two tRNAs in a eukaryote, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data show that in yeast errors vary by codon from a low of 4 x 10(-5) to a high of 6.9 x 10(-4) per codon and that error frequency is in general about threefold lower than in E. coli, which may suggest that yeast has additional mechanisms that reduce missense errors. Error rate again is strongly influenced by tRNA competition. Surprisingly, missense errors involving wobble position mispairing were much less frequent in S. cerevisiae than in E. coli. Furthermore, the error-inducing aminoglycoside antibiotic, paromomycin, which stimulates errors on all error-prone codons in E. coli, has a more codon-specific effect in yeast.},

This process is highly accurate, however, at low frequencies (10(-3)-10(-4)) the wrong aa-tRNA can be selected, leading to incorporation of aberrant amino acids. Although our understanding of what constitutes the correct or cognate aa-tRNA: mRNA interaction is well defined, a functional distinction between near-cognate or single mismatched, and unpaired or non-cognate interactions is lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings. Misreading of several synonymous codon substitutions at the catalytic site of firefly luciferase was assayed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of the results in the context of current kinetic and biophysical models of aa-tRNA selection suggests that the defining feature of near-cognate aa-tRNAs is their potential to form mini-helical structures with A-site codons, enabling stimulation of GTPase activity of eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1A (eEF1A). Paromomycin specifically stimulated misreading of near-cognate but not of non-cognate aa-tRNAs, providing a functional probe to distinguish between these two classes. Deletion of the accessory elongation factor eEF1B gamma promoted increased misreading of near-cognate, but hyperaccurate reading of non-cognate codons, suggesting that this factor also has a role in tRNA discrimination. A mutant of eEF1B alpha, the nucleotide exchange factor for eEF1A, promoted a general increase in fidelity, suggesting that the decreased rates of elongation may provide more time for discrimination between aa-tRNAs. A mutant form of ribosomal protein L5 promoted hyperaccurate decoding of both types of codons, even though it is topologically distant from the decoding center. Conclusions/Signficance. It is important to distinguish between near-cognate and non-cognate mRNA: tRNA interactions, because such a definition may be important for informing therapeutic strategies for suppressing these two different categories of mutations underlying many human diseases. This study suggests that the defining feature of near-cognate aa-tRNAs is their potential to form mini-helical structures with A-site codons in the ribosomal decoding center. An aminoglycoside and a ribosomal factor can be used to distinguish between near-cognate and non-cognate interactions.},

Recent crystal structures of near-cognate tRNAs accommodated into the ribosomal A-site, however, show canonical geometry even with first and second position mismatches. This immediately raises the question of whether these structures correspond to tautomerization of the base pairs. Further, if unusual tautomers are indeed trapped why do they not cause errors in decoding? Here, we use molecular dynamics free energy calculations of ribosomal complexes with cognate and near-cognate tRNAs to analyze the structures and energetics of G-U mismatches in the first two codon positions. We find that the enol tautomer of G is almost isoenergetic with the corresponding ketone in the first position, while it is actually more stable in the second position. Tautomerization of U, on the other hand is highly penalized. The presence of the unusual enol form of G thus explains the crystallographic observations. However, the calculations also show that this tautomer does not cause high codon reading error frequencies, as the resulting tRNA binding free energies are significantly higher than for the cognate complex.},

No prestructuring effect on the tRNA anticodon stem-loop from the two modifications could be observed, but we identified two mechanisms that may contribute to the expanded decoding capability by the modifications: The further reach of the cmo(5)U34 allows an alternative outer conformation to be formed for the noncognate base pairs, and the modification results in increased contacts between tRNA, mRNA, and the ribosome.},

With currently over 150 known nucleoside alterations, detection and quantification methods must encompass multiple modifications for a comprehensive profile. LC-MS/MS approaches offer a perspective for comprehensive parallel quantification of all the various modifications found in total RNA of a given organism. By feeding C-13-glucose as sole carbon source, we have generated a stable isotope-labeled internal standard (SIL-IS) for bacterial RNA, which facilitates relative comparison of all modifications. While conventional SIL-IS approaches require the chemical synthesis of single modifications in weighable quantities, this SIL-IS consists of a nucleoside mixture covering all detectable RNA modifications of Escherichia coli, yet in small and initially unknown quantities. For absolute in addition to relative quantification, those quantities were determined by a combination of external calibration and sample spiking of the biosynthetic SIL-IS. For each nucleoside, we thus obtained a very robust relative response factor, which permits direct conversion of the MS signal to absolute amounts of substance. The application of the validated SIL-IS allowed highly precise quantification with standard deviations <2\% during a 12-week period, and a linear dynamic range that was extended by two orders of magnitude.},

As a product of novel genomic and bioanalytical technologies, this model has strong parallels with the regulatory networks of DNA methylation in epigenetics and the variety of protein secondary modifications comprising signaling pathways and the histone code. When present at the tRNA wobble position, the modified ribonucleosides enhance the translation of mRNAs in which the cognate codons of the tRNAs are highly over-represented and that represent critical stress response proteins. A parallel system may also downregulate the translation of families of proteins. Notably, dysregulation of the tRNA methyltransferase enzymes in humans has also been implicated in cancer etiology, with demonstrated oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects.},

A significant impact on tRNA stability is exerted by a variety of nucleotide modifications. Pre-tRNAs are targets of exosome-dependent surveillance in the nucleus. Some tRNAs that are hypomodified or bear specific destabilizing mutations are directed to the rapid tRNA decay pathway leading to 53 exonucleolytic degradation by Rat1 and Xrn1. tRNA molecules are selectively marked for degradation by a double CCA at their 3 ends. In addition, under different stress conditions, tRNA half-molecules can be generated by independent endonucleolytic cleavage events.

Genetic, genomic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches possible in the powerful Saccharomyces cerevisiae system have led to exciting advances in our understandings of tRNA post-transcriptional processing as well as to novel insights into tRNA turnover and tRNA subcellular dynamics. tRNA processing steps include removal of transcribed leader and trailer sequences, addition of CCA to the 3' mature sequence and, for tRNA(His), addition of a 5' G. About 20\% of yeast tRNAs are encoded by intron-containing genes. The three-step splicing process to remove the introns surprisingly occurs in the cytoplasm in yeast and each of the splicing enzymes appears to moonlight in functions in addition to tRNA splicing. There are 25 different nucleoside modifications that are added post-transcriptionally, creating tRNAs in which similar to 15\% of the residues are nucleosides other than A, G, U, or C. These modified nucleosides serve numerous important functions including tRNA discrimination, translation fidelity, and tRNA quality control. Mature tRNAs are very stable, but nevertheless yeast cells possess multiple pathways to degrade inappropriately processed or folded tRNAs. Mature tRNAs are also dynamic in cells, moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and back again to the cytoplasm; the mechanism and function of this retrograde process is poorly understood. Here, the state of knowledge for tRNA post-transcriptional processing, turnover, and subcellular dynamics is addressed, highlighting the questions that remain.},

This is possible because of the tRNA's ability to 'wobble' at the third base to decode more than one codon. Although the anticodon-codon mapping of tRNA to mRNA is a prerequisite for certain codon usage indices and can contribute to the understanding of the evolution of alternative genetic codes, it is usually not determined experimentally because such assays are prohibitively expensive and elaborate. Instead, the codon reading is approximated from theoretical inferences of nucleotide binding, the wobble rules. Unfortunately, these rules fail to capture all of the nuances of codon reading. This study addresses the codon reading properties of tRNAs and their evolutionary impact on codon usage bias. Results: Using three different computational methods, the signal of tRNA decoding in codon usage bias is identified. The predictions by the methods generally agree with each other and compare well with experimental evidence of codon reading. This analysis suggests a revised codon reading for cytosolic tRNA in the yeast genome (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that is more accurate than the common assignment by wobble rules. The results confirm the earlier observation that the wobble rules are not sufficient for a complete description of codon reading, because they depend on genome-specific factors. The computational methods presented here are applicable to any fully sequenced genome.},

Availability of whole-genome sequences allowed us to examine tRNA gene copy number variation (tgCNV) and codon use in four Schizosaccharomyces species and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. tRNA gene numbers vary from 171 to 322 in the four Schizosaccharomyces despite very high similarity in other features of their genomes. In addition, we performed whole-genome sequencing of several related laboratory strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and found tgCNV at a cluster of tRNA genes. We examined for the first time effects of wobble rules on correlation of tRNA gene number and codon use and showed improvement for S. cerevisiae and three of the Schizosaccharomyces species. In contrast, correlation in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus is poor due to markedly divergent tRNA gene content, and much worsened by the wobble rules. In japonicus, some tRNA iso-acceptor genes are absent and others are greatly reduced relative to the other yeasts, while genes for synonymous wobble iso-acceptors are amplified, indicating wobble use not apparent in any other eukaryote. We identified a subset of japonicus-specific wobbles that improves correlation of codon use and tRNA gene content in japonicus. We conclude that tgCNV is high among Schizo species and occurs in related laboratory strains of S. pombe (and expectedly other species), and tRNAome-codon analyses can provide insight into species-specific wobble decoding.},

This led to a new appreciation of the key roles of tRNA modifications and tRNA modification enzymes as checkpoints for tRNA integrity and for integrating translation with other cellular functions such as transcription, primary metabolism, and stress resistance.

A major determinant of miaA activity is known to be the single-stranded tRNA sequence, A36A37A38, in a stem-loop. tRNA(CCA)(Trp) from either yeast is a Tit1p substrate, but neither is a Mod5p substrate despite the presence of A36A37A38. We show that Tit1p accommodates a broader range of substrates than Mod5p. tRNA(CCA)(Trp) is distinct from Mod5p substrates, which we sort into two classes based on the presence of G at position 34 and other elements. A single substitution of C34 to G converts tRNA(CCA)(Trp) to a Mod5p substrate in vitro and in vivo, consistent with amino acid contacts to G34 in existing Mod5p-tRNA(GCA)(Cys) crystal structures. Mutation of Mod5p in its G34 recognition loop region debilitates it differentially for its G34 (class I) substrates. Multiple alignments reveal that the G34 recognition loop sequence of Mod5p differs significantly from Tit1p, which more resembles human TRIT1 and other DMATases. We show that TRIT1 can also modify tRNA(CCA)(Trp) consistent with broad recognition similar to Tit1p. This study illustrates previously unappreciated molecular plasticity and biological diversity of the tRNA-isopentenyltransferase system of eukaryotes.},

abstract ={
Protein products of highly expressed genes tend to favor amino acids that have lower average biosynthetic costs (i.e., they exhibit metabolic efficiency). While this trend has been observed in several studies, the specific sites where cost-reducing substitutions accumulate have not been well characterized. Toward that end, weighted costs in conserved and variable positions were evaluated across a total of 9,119 homologous proteins in four mammalian orders (primate, carnivore, rodent, and artiodactyls), which together contain a total of 20,457,072 amino acids. Degree of conservation at homologous positions in these mammalian proteins and average-weighted cost across all positions within a single protein are significantly correlated. Dividing human genes into two classes (those with and those without CpG islands in their promoters) suggests that humans also preferentially utilize less costly amino acids in highly expressed genes. In contrast to the intuitive expectation that the relatively weak selective force associated with metabolic efficiency would be a selection pressure in complex multicellular organisms, the overall level of selective constraint within the variable regions of mammalian proteins allows the metabolic efficiency to derive a reduction of overall biosynthetic cost, particularly in genes with the highest levels of expression.

abstract = {Studies on the genetics of adaptation from new mutations typically neglect the possibility that a deleterious mutation might fix. Nonetheless, here we show that, in many regimes, the first mutation to fix is most often deleterious, even when fitness is expected to increase in the long term. In particular, we prove that this phenomenon occurs under weak mutation for any house-of-cards model with an equilibrium distribution. We find that the same qualitative results hold under Fisher's geometric model. We also provide a simple intuition for the surprising prevalence of unconditionally deleterious substitutions during early adaptation. Importantly, the phenomenon we describe occurs on fitness landscapes without any local maxima and is therefore distinct from valley crossing. Our results imply that the common practice of ignoring deleterious substitutions leads to qualitatively incorrect predictions in many regimes. Our results also have implications for the substitution process at equilibrium and for the response to a sudden decrease in population size.},

   disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in
   tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell
   types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for
   interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results
   demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding
   gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

Abstract = {The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the
   vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The
   Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped
   regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin
   structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign
   biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of
   the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate
   regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with
   expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene
   regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical
   correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can
   thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project
   provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes
   and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for
   biomedical research.},

abstract ={Do data from the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project render the notion of junk DNA obsolete? Here, I review older arguments for junk grounded in the C-value paradox and propose a thought experiment to challenge ENCODE~s ontology. Specifically, what would we expect for the number of functional elements (as ENCODE defines them) in genomes much larger than our own genome? If the number were to stay more or less constant, it would seem sensible to consider the rest of the DNA of larger genomes to be junk or, at least, assign it a different sort of role (structural rather than informational). If, however, the number of functional elements were to rise significantly with C-value then, (i) organisms with genomes larger than our genome are more complex phenotypically than we are, (ii) ENCODE~s definition of functional element identifies many sites that would not be considered functional or phenotype-determining by standard uses in biology, or (iii) the same phenotypic functions are often determined in a more diffuse fashion in larger-genomed organisms. Good cases can be made for propositions ii and iii. A larger theoretical framework, embracing informational and structural roles for DNA, neutral as well as adaptive causes of complexity, and selection as a multilevel phenomenon, is needed.},

Such strand bias in genomes, frequently visualized by GC skew graphs, is used for the computational prediction of transcription start sites and replication origins, as well as for comparative evolutionary genomics studies. The use of measures of compositional strand bias in order to quantify the degree of strand asymmetry is crucial, as it is the basis for determining the applicability of compositional analysis and comparing the strength of the mutational bias in different biological machineries in various species. Here, we review the measures of strand bias that have been proposed to date, including the Delta GC skew, the B-1 index, the predictability score of linear discriminant analysis for gene orientation, the signal-to-noise ratio of the oligonucleotide bias, and the GC skew index. These measures have been predominantly designed for and applied to the analysis of replication-related mutational processes in prokaryotes, but we also give research examples in eukaryotes.

	abstract    = {In the present review, we summarized current knowledge on replicative strand asymmetries in prokaryotic genomes. A cornerstone for the creation of a theory of their formation has been overviewed. According to our recent works, the probability of nonsense mutation caused by replication-associated mutational pressure is higher for genes from lagging strands than for genes from leading strands of both bacterial and archaeal genomes. Lower density of open reading frames in lagging strands can be explained by faster rates of nonsense mutations in genes situated on them. According to the asymmetries in nucleotide usage in fourfold and twofold degenerate sites, the direction of replication-associated mutational pressure for genes from lagging strands is usually the same as the direction of transcription-associated mutational pressure. It means that lagging strands should accumulate more 8-oxo-G, uracil and 5-formyl-uracil, respectively. In our opinion, consequences of cytosine deamination (C to T transitions) do not lead to the decrease of cytosine usage in genes from lagging strands because of the consequences of thymine oxidation (T to C transitions), while guanine oxidation (causing G to T transversions) makes the main contribution into the decrease of guanine usage in fourfold degenerate sites of genes from lagging strands. Nucleotide usage asymmetries and bias in density of coding regions can be found in archaeal genomes, although, the percent of "inversed" asymmetries is much higher for them than for bacterial genomes. "Homogenized" and "inversed" replicative strand asymmetries in archaeal genomes can be used as retrospective indexes for detection of OriC translocations and large inversions.},

	abstract    = {Background: Most bacterial chromosomes exhibit asymmetry of base composition with respect to leading vs. lagging strands ( GC and AT skews). These skews reflect mainly those in protein coding sequences, which are driven by asymmetric mutation pressures during replication and transcription ( notably asymmetric cytosine deamination) plus subsequent selection for preferred structures, signals, amino acid or codons. The transcription-associated effects but not the replication-associated effects contribute to the overall skews through the uneven distribution of the coding sequences on the leading and lagging strands.Results: Analysis of 185 representative bacterial chromosomes showed diverse and characteristic patterns of skews among different clades. The base composition skews in the coding sequences were used to derive quantitatively the effect of replication-driven mutation plus subsequent selection ('replication-associated pressure', RAP), and the effect of transcription-driven mutation plus subsequent selection at translation level ('transcription-associate pressure', TAP). While different clades exhibit distinct patterns of RAP and TAP, RAP is absent or nearly absent in some bacteria, but TAP is present in all. The selection pressure at the translation level is evident in all bacteria based on the analysis of the skews at the three codon positions. Contribution of asymmetric cytosine deamination was found to be weak to TAP in most phyla, and strong to RAP in all the Proteobacteria but weak in most of the Firmicutes. This possibly reflects the differences in their chromosomal replication machineries. A strong negative correlation between TAP and G+C content and between TAP and chromosomal size were also revealed.Conclusion: The study reveals the diverse mutation and selection forces associated with replication and transcription in various groups of bacteria that shape the distinct patterns of base composition skews in the chromosomes during evolution. Some closely relative species with distinct base composition parameters are uncovered in this study, which also provides opportunities for comparative bioinformatic and genetic investigations to uncover the underlying principles for mutation and selection.

To circumvent these predicaments, all possible pairs of neighboring genes that are located on different strands of nuclear DNA were selected from the complete genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens. For such a pair of genes, one is likely coded from the leading strand and the other from the lagging strand. By examining the introns and the fourfold degenerate sites of codons in the genes of each pair, we found that the relative frequencies of T vs. A and of G vs. C are significantly skewed in most eukaryotes studied. In a gene pair, the potential effects of replicationand transcription-associated mutation bias on strand asymmetry are in the same direction for one gene where leading strand synthesis shares the same template with transcription, while they tend to be canceled out in the other gene. Our study demonstrates that DNA replication-associated and transcription-associated mutation bias and/or selective codon usage bias may affect the strand nucleotide composition asymmetrically in eukaryotic genomes.

The asymmetry is seen in coding and non-coding sequences and is reflected in the amino acid composition of proteins. The mechanisms generating asymmetry include: unequal mutation rates connected with replication and transcription, selection forces positioning genes and signal sequences nonrandomly in the genome, and protein coding constraints on coding sequences. There are different methods of visualising and measuring the asymmetry. Some of them can assess the contribution of individual mechanisms to the observed asymmetry and those have been described in greater detail. Asymmetric mutational and selection pressures differentiate the rates of evolution of genes on leading and lagging strands. The genes relocated to the opposite strand have to adapt to a different mutational pressure or are eliminated. Translocations from leading to lagging strands are more often selected against than from lagging to leading strands. Comparison of intergenic sequences that have lost the coding function to the original genes enables finding the frequencies of the twelve substitution rates in sequences free from selection. In the absence of selection, the half-time of substitution of a given type of nucleotide is linearly correlated with the fraction of that nucleotide in the sequence.

This species diverged from Saccharomyces cerevisiae before the ancestral whole genome duplication. The genome comprises eight chromosomes among which achromosomal arm of 1Mb has a G + C-content much higher than the rest of the genome. We identified 252 active replication origins in L. kluyveri and found considerable divergence in origin location with S. cerevisiae and with Lachancea waltii. Although some global features of S. cerevisiae replication are conserved: Centromeres replicate early, whereas telomeres replicate late, we found that replication origins both in L. kluyveri and L. waltii do not behave as evolutionary fragile sites. In L. kluyveri, replication timing along chromosomes alternates between regions of early and late activating origins, except for the 1Mb GC-rich chromosomal arm. This chromosomal arm contains an origin consensus motif different from other chromosomes and is replicated early during S-phase. We showed that precocious replication results from the specific absence of late firing origins in this chromosomal arm. In addition, we found a correlation between GC-content and distance from replication origins as well as a lack of replication-associated compositional skew between leading and lagging strands specifically in this GC-rich chromosomal arm. These findings suggest that the unusual base composition in the genome of L. kluyveri could be linked to replication.},

Applying this scale to ten closely related yeast species, we uncover the evolutionary conservation of codon optimality in eukaryotes. This analysis reveals universal patterns of conserved optimal and nonoptimal codons, often in clusters, which associate with the secondary structure of the translated polypeptides independent of the levels of expression. Our analysis suggests an evolved function for codon optimality in regulating the rhythm of elongation to facilitate cotranslational polypeptide folding, beyond its previously proposed role of adapting to the cost of expression. These findings establish how mRNA sequences are generally under selection to optimize the cotranslational folding of corresponding polypeptides.},

Recent evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA) function may affect synonymous codon choices near miRNA target sites. To better understand this, we perform genome-wide analysis on synonymous codon usage around miRNA target sites in four plant genomes. We observed a general trend of increased site accessibility around miRNA target sites in plants. Guanine-cytosine (GC)-poor codons are preferred in the flank region of miRNA target sites. Within-genome analyses show significant variation among miRNA targets in species. GC content of the target gene can partly explain the variation of site accessibility among miRNA targets. miRNA targets in GC-rich genes show stronger selection signals than those in GC-poor genes. Gene's codon usage bias and the conservation level of miRNA and its target also have some effects on site accessibility, but the expression level of miRNA or its target and the mechanism of miRNA activity do not contribute to site accessibility differences among miRNA targets. We suggest that synonymous codons near miRNA targets are selected for efficient miRNA binding and proper miRNA function. Our results present a new dimension of natural selection on synonymous codons near miRNA target sites in plants, which will have important implications of coding sequence evolution.},

With small scaled mutation rates theta(0) and theta(1), which is appropriate for single nucleotide polymorphism data in highly recombining regions, we derive a simple approximate equilibrium distribution for polymorphic alleles with a constant of proportionality. We also put forth an even simpler model, where all mutations originate from monomorphic states. Using this model we derive the sojourn times, conditional on the ancestral and fixed allele, and under equilibrium the distributions of fixed and polymorphic alleles and fixation rates. Furthermore, we also derive the distribution of small samples in the diffusion limit and provide convenient recurrence relations for calculating this distribution. This enables us to give formulas analogous to the Ewens-Watterson estimator of theta for biased mutation rates and selection. We apply this theory to a polymorphism dataset of fourfold degenerate sites in Drosophila melanogaster. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Surprisingly, preferentially used codons are not translated faster than unpreferred ones. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is a result of codon usage in proportion to cognate tRNA concentrations, the optimal strategy in enhancing translational efficiency under tRNA shortage. Our predicted codon-tRNA balance is indeed observed from all model eukaryotes examined, and its impact on translational efficiency is further validated experimentally.

We perform the first genome-wide study of natural selection operating on TE in recent human evolution, surveying 13,798 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,198 unrelated individuals from 11 populations. We find evidence for both negative and positive selection on TE, as measured based on differentiation in allele frequencies between populations. Notably, the likelihood of an SNP to be targeted by positive or negative selection is correlated with the magnitude of its effect on the TE of the corresponding protein. Furthermore, negative selection acting against changes in TE is more marked in highly expressed genes, highly interacting proteins, complex members, and regulatory genes. It is also more common in functional regions and in the initial segments of highly expressed genes. Positive selection targeting sites with a large effect on TE is stronger in lowly interacting proteins and in regulatory genes. Similarly, essential genes are enriched for negative TE selection while underrepresented for positive TE selection. Taken together, these results point to the significant role of TE as a selective force operating in humans and hence underscore the importance of considering silent SNPs in interpreting associations with complex human diseases. Testifying to this potential, we describe two synonymous SNPs that may have clinical implications in phenylketonuria and in Best's macular dystrophy due to TE differences between alleles.},

Using a maximum-likelihood framework, we then test whether conservative and nonconservative synonymous substitutions occur at equal rates. Our approach replaces the standard rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, dS, with two new rates, the conservative synonymous substitution rate (dS(C)) and the nonconservative synonymous substitution rate (dS(N)). Based on the ratio dS(N)/dS(C), we find that 0.05\% of all yeast genes and none of worm genes show evidence of positive selection at synonymous sites (dS(N)/dS(C) > 1). On the other hand, 9.44\% of all yeast genes and 5.12\% of all worm genes show evidence of significant purifying selection on synonymous sites (dS(N)/dS(C) < 1). We also find that dS(N) correlates strongly with gene expression level, whereas the correlation between expression level and dS(C) is very weak. Thus, dS(N) captures most of the signal of selection for translational accuracy and speed, whereas dS(C) is not strongly influenced by this selection pressure. We suggest that the ratio dN/dS(C) may be more appropriate than the ratio dN/dS to identify positive or purifying selection on amino acids.},

Selection can, however, also act at the RNA level, for example, to facilitate rapid translation or ensure correct splicing. Here, we ask whether the way DNA works also imposes constraints on coding sequence evolution. We identify nucleosome positioning as a likely candidate to set up such a DNA-level selective regime and use high-resolution microarray data in yeast to compare the evolution of coding sequence bound to or free from nucleosomes. Controlling for gene expression and intragene location, we find a nucleosome-free ''linker'' sequence to evolve on average 5-6\% slower at synonymous sites. A reduced rate of evolution in linker is especially evident at the 59 end of genes, where the effect extends to non-synonymous substitution rates. This is consistent with regular nucleosome architecture in this region being important in the context of gene expression control. As predicted, codons likely to generate a sequence unfavourable to nucleosome formation are enriched in linker sequence. Amino acid content is likewise skewed as a function of nucleosome occupancy. We conclude that selection operating on DNA to maintain correct positioning of nucleosomes impacts codon choice, amino acid choice, and synonymous and non-synonymous rates of evolution in coding sequence. The results support the exclusion model for nucleosome positioning and provide an alternative interpretation for runs of rare codons. As the intimate association of histones and DNA is a universal characteristic of genic sequence in eukaryotes, selection on coding sequence composition imposed by nucleosome positioning should be phylogenetically widespread.},

The pattern of reduction depends oil the selective advantage and recurrence rate of the sweeps. Because many adaptive substitutions responsible for these sweeps also contribute to non-synonymous divergence, the spatial distribution of non-synonymous divergence also reflects the distribution of adaptive substitutions. Thus, the spatial correspondence between neutral polymorphism and non-synonymous divergence may be especially informative about the process of adaptation. Here we study this 1 0 correspondence using genomewide polymorphism data from Drosophila simulans and the divergence between D. simulans and D. melanogaster: Focusing on highly recombining portions of the autosomes, at a spatial scale appropriate to the study of selective sweeps, we find that. neutral polymorphism is both lower and, as measured by a new statistic Qs, less homogeneous where non-synonymous divergence is higher and that the spatial structure of this correlation is best explained by the action of strong recurrent selective sweeps. We introduce a method to infer, from the spatial correspondence between polymorphism and divergence, the rate and selective strength of adaptation. Our results independently confirm a high rate of adaptive substitution (similar to 1/3000 generations) and newly suggest. that many adaptations are of surprisingly great selective effect (similar to 1\%), reducing the effective population size by similar to 15\% even in highly recombining regions of the genome.},

	abstract    = {The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations (DFE) is important for addressing several questions in genetics, including the nature of quantitative variations and the evolutionary fate of small populations. Properties of the DFE can be inferred by comparing the distributions of the frequencies of segregating nucleotide polymorphisms at selected and neutral sites in a population sample, but demographic changes alter the spectrum for. We have developed a maximum-likelihood approach, based on the expected allele-frequency distribution generated by transition matrix methods, to estimate parameters of the DFE while simultaneously estimating parameters of a demographic model that allows a populations size change at some time in the past. We tested the method using simulations and found that it accurately recovers simulated parameters values, even if the simulated demography differs substantially from that assumed in our analysis. We use our method to estimate parameters of the DFE for amino acid-changing mutations in humans and Drosophila melanogaster. For a model of unconditionally deleterious mutations, with effects sampled from a gamma distribution, the mean estimate for the distribution shape parameter is similar to 0.2 for human populations, which implies that the DFE is strongly leptokurtic. For Drosophila populations, we estimate that the shape parameter is similar to 0.35. Differences in the shape of the distribution and the mean selection coefficient between humans and Drosophila result in significantly more strongly deleterious mutations in Drosophila than in humans, and, conversely, nearly neutral mutations are significantly less frequent.},

	abstract    = {That natural selection affects molecular evolution at synonymous sites in protein-coding sequences is well established and is thought to predominantly reflect selection for translational efficiency/accuracy mediated through codon bias. However, a recently developed maximum likelihood framework, when applied to 18 coding sequences in 3 species of Drosophila, confirmed an earlier report that the Notch gene in Drosophila melanogaster was evolving under selection in favor of those codons defined as unpreferred in this species. This finding opened the possibility that synonymous sites may be subject to a variety of selective pressures beyond weak selection for increased frequencies of the codons currently defined as "preferred'' in D. melanogaster. To further explore patterns of synonymous site evolution in Drosophila in a lineage-specific manner, we expanded the application of the maximum likelihood framework to 8,452 protein coding sequences with well-defined orthology in D. melanogaster, Drosophila sechellia, and Drosophila yakuba. Our analyses reveal intragenomic and interspecific variation in mutational patterns as well as in patterns and intensity of selection on synonymous sites. In D. melanogaster, our results provide little statistical evidence for recent selection on synonymous sites, and Notch remains an outlier. In contrast, in D. sechellia our findings provide evidence in support of selection predominantly in favor of preferred codons. However, there is a small subset of genes in this species that appear to be evolving under selection in favor of unpreferred codons, which indicates that selection on synonymous sites is not limited to the preferential fixation of mutations that enhance the speed or accuracy of translation in this species.},

However, neither a reduction in the strength of selection nor a change in the mutational pattern can alone explain all of the data observed in the D. melanogaster lineage. For example, we also confirm previous results showing that the Notch locus has experienced positive selection for previously classified unpreferred mutations.},

To investigate the quantitative relationship between parameters of mutation, selection, and demography, and patterns of synonymous site divergence, we have developed a novel combination of population genetic models and likelihood methods of phylogenetic sequence analysis. Comparing 50 orthologous gene pairs from Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis and 27 from D. melanogaster and D. simulans, we show considerable variation between amino acids and genes in the strength of selection acting on codon usage and. find evidence for both long-term and short-term changes in the strength of selection between species. Remarkably, D. melanogaster shows no evidence of current selection on codon usage, while its sister species D. simulans experiences only half the selection pressure for codon usage of their common ancestor. We also find evidence for considerable base asymmetries in the rate of mutation, such that the average synonymous mutation rate is 20-30\% higher than in noncoding regions. A Bayesian approach is adopted to investigate how accounting for selection on codon usage influences estimates of tho parameters of mutation.},

	abstract    = {Codon bias has been observed in many species. The usage of selective codons in a given gene is positively correlated with its expression efficiency. As an experimental approach to study codon-usage effects on heterologous gene expression in mammalian cells, we designed two human erythropoietin(EPO) genes, one in which native codons were systematically substituted with codons frequently found in highly expressed human genes and the other with codons prevalent in yeast genes. Relative performances of the re-engineered EPO genes were evaluated with various combinations of promoters and signal leader sequences. Under the comparable set of combinations, mature EPO gene with human high-frequency codons gave a considerably higher level of expression than that with yeast high-frequency codons. However, the levels of EPO expression varied, depending on the alternate combinations. Since the promoters and the signal leader sequences that we used are known to be equally efficient in gene expression, we hypothesized that the varied expression levels were due to the linear sequence between the promoter and the coding gene sequence. To test this possibility, we designed the EPO gene with hybrid codon usage in which the 5'-proximal region of the EPO gene was synthesized with yeast-biased codons and the rest with human-biased codons. This codon-usage hybrid EPO gene substantially enhanced the level of EPO transcripts and proteins up to 2.9-fold and 13.8-fold, respectively, when compared to the revel reached by the original counterpart. Our results suggest that the linear sequence between the promoter and the 5'-proximal region of a gene plays an important role in achieving high-level expression in mammalian cells.

	abstract    = {Patterns of codon usage and ''silent'' DNA divergence suggest that natural selection discriminates among synonymous codons in Drosophila. ''Preferred'' codons are consistently found in higher frequencies within their synonymous families in Drosophila melanogaster genes. This suggests a simple model of silent DNA evolution where natural selection favors mutations from unpreferred to preferred codons (preferred changes). Changes in the opposite direction, from preferred to unpreferred synonymous codons (unpreferred changes), are selected against. Here, selection on synonymous DNA mutations is investigated by comparing the evolutionary dynamics of these two categories of silent DNA changes. Sequences from outgroups are used to determine the direction of synonymous DNA changes within and between D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans for five genes. Population genetics theory shows that differences in the fitness effect of mutations can be inferred from the comparison of ratios of polymorphism to divergence. Unpreferred changes show a significantly higher ratio of polymorphism to divergence than preferred changes in the D. simulans lineage, confirming the action of selection at silent sites. An excess of unpreferred fixations in 28 genes suggests a relaxation of selection on synonymous mutations in D. melanogaster. Estimates of selection coefficients for synonymous mutations (3.6 < \N(e)s\ < 1.3) in D. simulans are consistent with the reduced efficacy of natural selection (\N(e)s\ < 1) in the threeto sixfold smaller effective population size of D. melanogaster. Synonymous DNA changes appear to be a prevalent class of weakly selected mutations in Drosophila.},

Poisson random field (PRF) theory was used to derive the expected distribution of frequencies of nucleotides differing from the ancestral state at aligned sites in a set of DNA sequences. This distribution was applied to synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms and amino acid polymorphisms in the gnd and putP genes of Escherichia coli. For the gnd gene, the average intensity of selection against disfavored synonymous codons was estimated as approximately 7.3 X 10(-9); this value is significantly smaller than the estimated selection intensity against selectively disfavored amino acids in observed polymorphisms (2.0 X 10(-8)), but it is approximately of the same order of magnitude. The selection coefficients for optimal synonymous codons estimated from PRF theory were consistent with independent estimates based on codon usage for threonine and glycine. Across 118 genes in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the distribution of estimated selection coefficients, expressed as multiples of the effective population size, has a mean and standard deviation of 0.5 +/- 0.4. No significant differences were found in the degree of codon bias between conserved positions and replacement positions, suggesting that translational misincorporation is not an important selective constraint among synonymous polymorphic codons in enteric bacteria. However, across the first 100 codons of the genes, conserved amino acids with identical codons have significantly greater codon bias than that of either synonymous or nonidentical codons, suggesting that there are unique selective constraints, perhaps including mRNA secondary structures, in this part of the coding region.},

The model is applied to the sample configurations of nucleotides in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba. Assuming a synonymous mutation rate of 1.5 X 10(-8) per site per year and 10 generations per year, we obtain estimates for the effective population size (N(e) = 6.5 X 10(6)), the species divergence time (t(div) = 3.74 million years), and an average selection coefficient (sigma = 1.53 X 10(-6) per generation for advantageous or mildly detrimental replacements), although it is conceivable that only two of the amino acid replacements were selected and the rest neutral. The analysis, which includes a sampling theory for the independent infinite sites model with selection, also suggests the estimate that the number of amino acids in the enzyme that are susceptible to favorable mutation is in the range 2-23 at any one time. The approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of a 2 X 2 contingency table to compare fixed differences and polymorphic sites with silent sites and amino acid replacements.},

We use site frequency spectra from deep population sequencing data to show that, contrary to this expectation, 22\% of four-fold synonymous (4D) sites in Drosophila melanogaster evolve under very strong selective constraint while few, if any, appear to be under weak constraint. Linking polymorphism with divergence data, we further find that the fraction of synonymous sites exposed to strong purifying selection is higher for those positions that show slower evolution on the Drosophila phylogeny. The function underlying the inferred strong constraint appears to be separate from splicing enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and the translational optimization generating canonical codon bias. The fraction of synonymous sites under strong constraint within a gene correlates well with gene expression, particularly in the mid-late embryo, pupae, and adult developmental stages. Genes enriched in strongly constrained synonymous sites tend to be particularly functionally important and are often involved in key developmental pathways. Given that the observed widespread constraint acting on synonymous sites is likely not to Drosophila, the role of synonymous sites in genetic disease and adaptation should be reevaluated.},

Our results suggest that data sets consisting of single or a small number of concatenated genes have a significant probability of supporting conflicting topologies. By contrast, analyses of the entire data set of concatenated genes yielded a single, fully resolved species tree with maximum support. Comparable results were obtained with a concatenation of a minimum of 20 genes; substantially more genes than commonly used but a small fraction of any genome.

doi = {10.1093/molbev/msv003}, 
abstract ={Numerous computational methods exist to assess the mode and strength of natural selection in protein-coding sequences, yet how distinct methods relate to one another remains largely unknown. Here, we elucidate the relationship between two widely used phylogenetic modeling frameworks: dN/dS models and mutation-selection (MutSel) models. We derive a mathematical relationship between dN/dS and scaled selection coefficients, the focal parameters of MutSel models, and use this relationship to gain deeper insight into the behaviors, limitations, and applicabilities of these two modeling frameworks. We prove that, if all synonymous changes are neutral, standard MutSel models correspond to dN/dS <= 1. However, if synonymous codons differ in fitness, dN/dS can take on arbitrarily high values even if all selection is purifying. Thus, the MutSel modeling framework cannot necessarily accommodate positive, diversifying selection, while dN/dS cannot distinguish between purifying selection on synonymous codons and positive selection on amino acids. We further propose a new benchmarking strategy of dN/dS inferences against MutSel simulations and demonstrate that the widely used Goldman-Yang-style dN/dS models yield substantially biased dN/dS estimates on realistic sequence data. In contrast, the less frequently used Muse-Gaut-style models display much less bias. Strikingly, the least-biased and most precise dN/dS estimates are never found in the models with the best fit to the data, measured through both AIC and BIC scores. Thus, selecting models based on goodness-of-fit criteria can yield poor parameter estimates if the models considered do not precisely correspond to the underlying mechanism that generated the data. In conclusion, establishing mathematical links among modeling frameworks represents a novel, powerful strategy to pinpoint previously unrecognized model limitations and strengths.},

	abstract    = {Extensive synonymous codon modification of viral genomes appears to be an effective way of attenuating strains for use as live vaccines. An assumption of this method is that codon changes have individually small effects, such that codon-attenuated viruses will be slow to evolve back to high fitness (and thus to high virulence). The major capsid gene of the bacterial virus T7 was modified to have varying levels of suboptimal synonymous codons in different constructs, and fitnesses declined linearly with the number of changes. Adaptation of the most extreme design, with 182 codon changes, resulted in a slow fitness recovery by standards of previous experimental evolution with this virus, although fitness effects of substitutions were higher than expected from the average effect of an engineered codon modification. Molecular evolution during recovery was modest, and changes evolved both within the modified gene and outside it. Some changes within the modified gene evolved in parallel across replicates, but with no obvious explanation. Overall, the study supports the premise that codon-modified viruses recover fitness slowly, although the evolution is substantially more rapid than expected from the design principle.},

Despite a good theoretical understanding of how evolution proceeds for a defined set of mutations, there is little understanding of constraints on net fitnesswhether fitness will reach a limit despite ongoing selection and mutation, and if there is a limit, what determines it. Here, the dsDNA bacteriophage SP6, a virus of Salmonella, was adapted to Escherichia coli K-12. From an isolate capable of modest growth on E. coli, four lines were adapted for rapid growth by protocols differing in use of mutagen, propagation method, and duration, but using the same media, temperature, and a continual excess of the novel host. Nucleotide changes underlying those adaptations differed greatly in number and identity, but the four lines achieved similar absolute fitness at the end, an increase of more than 4000-fold phage descendants per hour. Thus, the fitness landscape allows multiple genetic paths to the same approximate fitness limit. The existence and causes of fitness limits have ramifications to genome engineering, vaccine design, and lethal mutagenesis treatments to cure viral infections.},

However, they often ignore genetic details, which could confound these expectations. We experimentally analyzed the ability of organisms to evolve towards an optimum in an experimentally tractable system, lysis time in bacteriophage T7. T7 lysozyme helps lyse the host cell by degrading its cell wall at the end of infection, allowing viral escape to infect new hosts. Artificial deletion of lysozyme greatly reduced fitness and delayed lysis, but after evolution both phenotypes approached wild-type values. Phage with a lysis-deficient lysozyme evolved similarly. Several mutations were involved in adaptation, but most of the change in lysis timing and fitness increase was mediated by changes in gene 16, an internal virion protein not formerly considered to play a role in lysis. Its muralytic domain, which normally aids genome entry through the cell wall, evolved to cause phage release. Theoretical models suggest there is an optimal lysis time, and lysis more rapid or delayed than this optimum decreases fitness. Artificially constructed lines with very rapid lysis had lower fitness than wild-type T7, in accordance with the model. However, while a slow-lysing line also had lower fitness than wild-type, this low fitness resulted at least partly from genetic details that violated model assumptions.},

Both phage showed overall greater fitness effects per substitution during tire early stages of adaptation. The fitness of phiX174 improved from -0.7 to 5.6 doublings of phage concentration per generation. Five missense mutations were observed. The earliest two mutations accounted for 85\% of the ultimate fitness gain. In contrast, G4 required adaptation to the intermediate temperature of 41.5degrees before it could be maintained at 44degrees. Its fitness at 44degrees increased from -2.7 to 3.2, nearly the same net gain as in phiX174, but With three times the opportunity for adaptation. Seventeen mutations were observed in G4: 14 missense, 2 silent, and 1 intergenic. The first 3 missense substitutions accounted for over half the ultimate fitness increase. Although the expected pattern of periodic selective sweeps was the most common one for both phage, some mutations were lost after becoming frequent, and long-term polymorphism was observed. This study provides the greatest detail yet in combining fitness profiles with the underlying pattern of genetic changes, and the results support recent theories on the range of fitness effects of substitutions fixed during adaptation.},

When these phages were forced to grow again on Escherichia, fitness recovery occurred predominantly by reversions at these same sites, rather than by second-site compensatory changes, the more frequently observed mechanism in most microbial systems. The affected residues lie on the virion surface and they alter attachment efficiency, yet they occur iu a region distinct from a putative binding region previously identified from X-ray crystallography. These residues not only experienced high rates of evolution in our experiments, but also exhibited high levels of radical amino acid variation among phi X174 and its known relatives, consistent with a history of adaptation involving these sites.},

Misfolded proteins form insoluble aggregates and are hypothesized to be intrinsically cytotoxic. Here, we experimentally isolate a fitness cost caused by toxicity of misfolded proteins. We exclude other costs of protein misfolding, such as loss of functional protein or attenuation of growth-limiting protein synthesis resources, by comparing growth rates of budding yeast expressing folded or misfolded variants of a gratuitous protein, YFP, at equal levels. We quantify a fitness cost that increases with misfolded protein abundance, up to as much as a 3.2\% growth rate reduction when misfolded YFP represents less than 0.1\% of total cellular protein. Comparable experiments on variants of the yeast gene orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (URA3) produce similar results. Quantitative proteomic measurements reveal that, within the cell, misfolded YFP induces coordinated synthesis of interacting cytosolic chaperone proteins in the absence of a wider stress response, providing evidence for an evolved modular response to misfolded proteins in the cytosol. These results underscore the distinct and evolutionarily relevant molecular threat of protein misfolding, independent of protein function. Assuming that most misfolded proteins impose similar costs, yeast cells express almost all proteins at steady-state levels sufficient to expose their encoding genes to selection against misfolding, lending credibility to the recent suggestion that such selection imposes a global constraint on molecular evolution.},

Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.

This study explores the long-term impacts of fertility and socioeconomic position (SEP) on multiple dimensions of descendant success in a unique Swedish cohort of 14 000 individuals born during 1915-1929. We show that low fertility and high SEP predict increased descendant socioeconomic success across four generations. Furthermore, these effects are multiplicative, with the greatest benefits of low fertility observed when SEP is high. Low fertility and high SEP do not, however, predict increased descendant reproductive success. Our results are therefore consistent with the idea that modern fertility limitation represents a strategic response to the local costs of rearing socioeconomically competitive offspring, but contradict adaptive models suggesting that it maximizes long-term fitness. This indicates a conflict in modern societies between behaviours promoting socioeconomic versus biological success. This study also makes a methodological contribution, demonstrating that the number of offspring strongly predicts long-term fitness and thereby validating use of fertility data to estimate current selective pressures in modern populations. Finally, our findings highlight that differences in fertility and SEP can have important long-term effects on the persistence of social inequalities across generations.},

Although methods of studying selection in natural populations are well established, our understanding of selection in humans has been limited by the availability of suitable datasets. Here, we present a study comparing the maximum strengths of natural and sexual selection in humans that includes the effects of sex and wealth on different episodes of selection. Our dataset was compiled from church records of preindustrial Finnish populations characterized by socially imposed monogamy, and it contains a complete distribution of survival, mating, and reproductive success for 5,923 individuals born 1760-1849. Individual differences in early survival and fertility (natural selection) were responsible for most variation in fitness, even among wealthier individuals. Variance in mating success explained most of the higher variance in reproductive success in males compared with females, but mating success also influenced reproductive success in females, allowing for sexual selection to operate in both sexes. The detected opportunity for selection is in line with measurements for other species but higher than most previous reports for human samples. This disparity results from biological, demographic, economic, and social differences across populations as well as from failures by most previous studies to account for variation in fitness introduced by nonreproductive individuals. Our results emphasize that the demographic, cultural, and technological changes of the last 10,000 y did not preclude the potential for natural and sexual selection in our species.},

	abstract    = {It is often claimed that modern humans have stopped evolving because cultural and technological advancements have annihilated natural selection. In contrast, recent studies show that selection can be strong in contemporary populations. However, detecting a response to selection is particularly challenging; previous evidence from wild animals has been criticized for both applying anticonservative statistical tests and failing to consider random genetic drift. Here we study life-history variation in an insular preindustrial French-Canadian population and apply a recently proposed conservative approach to testing microevolutionary responses to selection. As reported for other such societies, natural selection favored an earlier age at first reproduction (AFR) among women. AFR was also highly heritable and genetically correlated to fitness, predicting a microevolutionary change toward earlier reproduction. In agreement with this prediction, AFR declined from about 26-22 y over a 140-y period. Crucially, we uncovered a substantial change in the breeding values for this trait, indicating that the change in AFR largely occurred at the genetic level. Moreover, the genetic trend was higher than expected under the effect of random genetic drift alone. Our results show that microevolution can be detectable over relatively few generations in humans and underscore the need for studies of human demography and reproductive ecology to consider the role of evolutionary processes.},

However, there is a lack of awareness of their importance amongst physicians, medical researchers, and educators, all of whom tend to focus on the mechanistic (proximate) basis for disease, excluding consideration of evolutionary (ultimate) reasons. The key principles of evolutionary medicine are that selection acts on fitness, not health or longevity; that our evolutionary history does not cause disease, but rather impacts on our risk of disease in particular environments; and that we are now living in novel environments compared to those in which we evolved. We consider these evolutionary principles in conjunction with population genetics and describe several pathways by which evolutionary processes can affect disease risk. These perspectives provide a more cohesive framework for gaining insights into the determinants of health and disease. Coupled with complementary insights offered by advances in genomic, epigenetic, and developmental biology research, evolutionary perspectives offer an important addition to understanding disease. Further, there are a number of aspects of evolutionary medicine that can add considerably to studies in other domains of contemporary evolutionary studies.},

The descendants of these women are predicted to be on average slightly shorter and stouter, to have lower total cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure, to have their first child earlier, and to reach menopause later than they would in the absence of evolution. Selection is tending to lengthen the reproductive period at both ends.

Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are long stretches of consecutive homozygous genotypes probably reflecting segments shared identically by descent as the result of processes such as consanguinity, population size reduction, and natural selection. The relationship between ROH and patterns of predicted deleterious variation can provide insight into the way in which these processes contribute to the maintenance of deleterious variants. Here, we use exome sequencing to examine ROH in relation to the distribution of deleterious variation in 27 individuals of varying levels of apparent inbreeding from 6 human populations. A significantly greater fraction of all genome-wide predicted damaging homozygotes fall in ROH than would be expected from the corresponding fraction of nondamaging homozygotes in ROH (p < 0.001). This pattern is strongest for long ROH (p < 0.05). ROH, and especially long ROH, harbor disproportionately more deleterious homozygotes than would be expected on the basis of the total ROH coverage of the genome and the genomic distribution of nondamaging homozygotes. The results accord with a hypothesis that recent inbreeding, which generates long ROH, enables rare deleterious variants to exist in homozygous form. Thus, just as inbreeding can elevate the occurrence of rare recessive diseases that represent homozygotes for strongly deleterious mutations, inbreeding magnifies the occurrence of mildly deleterious variants as well.},

The heritability has been estimated around 70\% and the genome-wide association meta-analyses conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium have been successful at identifying an increasing number of risk loci. Various theories have been proposed to explain why genetic variants that predispose to schizophrenia persist in the population, despite the fitness reduction in affected individuals, a question known as the evolutionary paradox. In this review, we consider evolutionary perspectives of schizophrenia and of the empirical evidence that may support these perspectives. Proposed evolutionary explanations include balancing selection, fitness trade-offs, fluctuating environments, sexual selection, mutation-selection balance and genomic conflicts. We address the expectations about the genetic architecture of schizophrenia that are predicted by different evolutionary scenarios and discuss the implications for genetic studies. Several potential sources of missing heritability, including geneenvironment interactions, epigenetic variation, and rare genetic variation are examined from an evolutionary perspective. A better understanding of evolutionary history may provide valuable clues to the genetic architecture of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, which is highly relevant to genetic studies that aim to detect genetic risk variants.

Here, we use runs of homozygosity in genome-wide SNP data to estimate the proportion of the autosome that exists in autozygous tracts in 9,388 cases with schizophrenia and 12,456 controls. We estimate that the odds of schizophrenia increase by similar to 17\% for every 1\% increase in genome-wide autozygosity. This association is not due to one or a few regions, but results from many autozygous segments spread throughout the genome, and is consistent with a role for multiple recessive or partially recessive alleles in the etiology of schizophrenia. Such a bias towards recessivity suggests that alleles that increase the risk of schizophrenia have been selected against over evolutionary time.

In the current article, we argue that greater insight, integration of knowledge, and empirical achievement in the study of family conflict can be realized by utilizing a powerful theory from evolutionary biology that is barely known within psychology: parent-offspring conflict theory (POCT). In the current article, we articulate POCT for psychological scientists, extend its scope by connecting it to the broader framework of life history theory, and draw out its implications for understanding conflict within human families. We specifically apply POCT to 2 instances of early mother-offspring interaction (prenatal conflict and weaning conflict); discuss the effects of genetic relatedness on behavioral conflict between parents, children, and their siblings; review the emerging literature on parent-offspring conflict over the choice of mates and spouses; and examine parent-offspring conflict from the perspective of imprinted genes. This review demonstrates the utility of POCT, not only for explaining what is known about conflict within families but also for generating novel hypotheses, suggesting new lines of research, and moving us toward the "big picture" by integrating across biological and psychological domains of knowledge.

One can see only the intermediate outcome from the balance of the exaggerated and opposed forces. Intermediate expression hides the underlying conflict, potentially misleading one to conclude that trait regulation is designed to achieve efficient and robust expression, rather than arising by the precarious resolution of conflict. Perturbation often reveals the underlying nature of evolutionary conflict. Upon mutation or knockout of one side in the conflict, the other previously hidden and exaggerated push on the trait may cause extreme, pathological expression. In this regard, pathology reveals hidden evolutionary design. We first review several evolutionary conflicts between males and females, including conflicts over mating, fertilization, and the growth rate of offspring. Perturbations of these conflicts lead to infertility, misregulated growth, cancer, behavioral abnormalities, and psychiatric diseases. We then turn to antagonism between the sexes over traits present in both males and females. For many traits, the different sexes favor different phenotypic values, and constraints prevent completely distinct expression in the sexes. In this case of sexual antagonism, we present a theory of conflict between X-linked genes and autosomal genes. We suggest that dysregulation of the exaggerated conflicting forces between the X chromosome and the autosomes may be associated with various pathologies caused by extreme expression along the male-female axis. Rapid evolution of conflicting X-linked and autosomal genes may cause divergence between populations and speciation.

The most striking evolutionary changes in humans are earlier weaning and prolonged subsequent pre-adult stages, which have structured and potentiated maladaptations related to growth and development. Data from human genetic and epigenetic studies, and mouse models, indicate that growth, development and behaviour during pre-adult stages are mediated to a notable degree by effects from genomic conflicts and imprinted genes. The incidence of cancer, the primary cause of non-infectious childhood mortality, mirrors child growth rates from birth to adolescence, with paediatric cancer development impacted by imprinted genes that control aspects of growth. Understanding the adaptive significance of child growth and development phenotypes, in the context of human-evolutionary changes and genomic conflicts, provides novel insights into the causes of disease in childhood.},

I first provide an overview of models for the origins and maintenance of genetically based disease risk in humans. I then discuss how analyses of genetic disease risk can be dovetailed with studies of positive and balancing selection, to evaluate the degree to which the 'genes that make us human' also represent the genes that mediate risk of polygenic disease. Finally, I present four basic principles for the nascent field of human evolutionary medical genomics, each of which represents a process that is nonintuitive from a proximate perspective. Joint consideration of these principles compels novel forms of interdisciplinary analyses, most notably studies that (i) analyze tradeoffs at the level of molecular genetics, and (ii) identify genetic variants that are derived in the human lineage or in specific populations, and then compare individuals with derived versus ancestral alleles.

Ever since 1943 when Leo Kanner co-opted "autism" to refer to a new condition involving "disturbance of affective contact" manifested in children, the relationship between schizophrenia and Kanner's autism has remained unclear. In this article I draw on data from studies of genomics, neurodevelopment, psychology, psychiatry and evolutionary biology to develop and evaluate alternative hypotheses for the relationship between autism and schizophrenia spectrum conditions. These data provide evidence for two hypotheses: partially-overlapping etiology of autism with schizophrenia mediated by common risk factors, and diametric causes of autism and schizophrenia mediated by genes underlying under-development versus dysregulated over-development of human social-brain phenotypes. The primary practical implications of these results are that: (1) false-positive diagnoses of premorbidity to schizophrenia-spectrum conditions as autistic spectrum conditions may be common, and may indicate a structural flaw in current diagnostic, nosological frameworks; (2) schizophrenia may be due in part to losses of function in negative regulators of social cognition and affect, rather than "deficits" in brain development; (3) the development of new pharmacological treatments for autism and schizophrenia can benefit directly from models of how autistic spectrum and schizophrenia spectrum conditions are etiologically related; and (4) future studies of autism, schizophrenia, and their relationship to one another must increasingly seek to integrate across analytic levels, from genes to neurodevelopment, neurological function, neuroanatomy, cognition, and evolutionary biology of the social brain, in the context of subtyping the substantial genetic and clinical heterogeneity found in each set of conditions.

This article identifies some of the most common concerns and attempts to elucidate evolutionary psychology's stance pertaining to them. These include issues of testability and falsfiability; the domain specificity versus domain generality of psychological mechanisms; the role of novel environments as they interact with evolved psychological circuits; the role of genes in the conceptual structure of evolutionary psychology; the roles of learning, socialization, and culture in evolutionary psychology; and the practical value of applied evolutionary psychology.

We have conducted the first comprehensive assessment of the extent and patterns of positive Darwinian selection on intellectual disability genes in humans. We report three main findings. First, as noted in some previous reports, intellectual disability genes with primary functions in the central nervous system exhibit a significant concentration to the X chromosome. Second, there was no evidence for a higher incidence of recent positive selection on X-linked than autosomal intellectual disability genes, nor was there a higher incidence of selection on such genes overall, compared to sets of control genes. However, the X-linked intellectual disability genes inferred to be subject to recent positive selection were concentrated in the Rho GTP-ase pathway, a key signaling pathway in neural development and function. Third, among all intellectual disability genes, there was evidence for a higher incidence of recent positive selection on genes involved in DNA repair, but not for genes involved in other functions. These results provide evidence that alterations to genes in the Rho GTP-ase and DNA-repair pathways may play especially-important roles in the evolution of human cognition and vulnerability to genetically-based intellectual disability.

	abstract    = {The apparently large genetic contribution to the aetiology of mental illness presents a formidable puzzle. Unlike common physical disorders, mental illness usually has an onset early in the reproductive age and is associated with substantial reproductive disadvantage. Therefore, genetic variants associated with vulnerability to mental illness should be under strong negative selection pressure and be eliminated from the genetic pool through natural selection. Still, mental disorders are common and twin studies indicate a strong genetic contribution to their aetiology. Several theories have been advanced to explain the paradox of high heritability and reproductive disadvantage associated with the same common phenotype, but none provides a satisfactory explanation for all types of mental illness. At the same time, identification of the molecular substrate underlying the large genetic contribution to the aetiology of mental illness is proving more difficult than expected. The quest for genetic variants associated with vulnerability to mental illness is predicated upon the common disease/common variant (CDCV) hypothesis. On the basis of a summary of evidence, it is concluded that the CDCV hypothesis is untenable for most types of mental illness. An alternative evolution-informed framework is proposed, which suggests that gene-environment interactions and rare genetic variants constitute most of the genetic contribution to mental illness. Common mental illness with mild reproductive disadvantage is likely to have a large contribution from interactions between common genetic variants and environmental exposures. Severe mental illness that confers strong reproductive disadvantage is likely to have a large and pleiotropic contribution from rare variants of recent origin. This framework points to a need for a paradigm change in genetic research to enable major progress in elucidating the aetiology of mental illness.

In addition to gross karyotypic rearrangements such as the fusion that formed human chromosome 2 and the human specific pericentric inversions of chromosomes 1 and 18, there is considerable submicroscopic structural variation involving deletions, duplications, and inversions. Lineage. specific segmental duplications, detected by array comparative genomic hybridization and direct sequence comparison, have made a very significant contribution to this structural divergence, which is at least three-fold greater than that due to nucleotide substitutions. Since structural genomic changes may have given rise to irreversible functional differences between the diverging species, their detailed analysis could help to identify the biological processes that have accompanied speciation. To this end, interspecies comparisons have revealed numerous human-specific gains and losses of genes as well as changes in gene expression. The very considerable structural diversity (polymorphism) evident within both lineages has, however, hampered the analysis of the structural divergence between the human and chimpanzee genomes. The concomitant evaluation of genetic divergence and diversity at the nucleotide level has nevertheless served to identify many genes that have evolved under positive selection and may thus have been involved in the development of human lineage specific traits. Genes that display signs of weak negative selection have also been identified and could represent candidate loci for complex genomic disorders. Here, we review recent progress in comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes and discuss how the differences detected have improved our understanding of the evolution of the human genome.},

We assess three leading explanations for this apparent paradox from evolutionary genetic theory: (1) ancestral neutrality (susceptibility alleles were not harmful among ancestors), (2) balancing selection (susceptibility alleles sometimes increased fitness), and (3) polygenic mutation-selection balance (mental disorders reflect the inevitable mutational load on the thousands of genes underlying human behavior). The first two explanations are commonly assumed in psychiatric genetics and Darwinian psychiatry, while mutation-selection has often been discounted. All three models can explain persistent genetic variance in some traits under some conditions, but the first two have serious problems in explaining human mental disorders. Ancestral neutrality fails to explain low mental disorder frequencies and requires implausibly small selection coefficients against mental disorders given the data on the reproductive costs and impairment of mental disorders. Balancing selection (including spatio-temporal variation in selection, heterozygote advantage, antagonistic pleiotropy, and frequency-dependent selection) tends to favor environmentally contingent adaptations (which would show no heritability) or high-frequency alleles (which psychiatric genetics would have already found). Only polygenic mutation-selection balance seems consistent with the data on mental disorder prevalence rates, fitness costs, the likely rarity of susceptibility alleles, and the increased risks of mental disorders with brain trauma, inbreeding, and paternal age. This evolutionary genetic framework for mental disorders has wide-ranging implications for psychology, psychiatry, behavior genetics, molecular genetics, and evolutionary approaches to studying human behavior.

The growing recognition of the molecular mechanisms of pathogen-induced oncogenesis and the difficulty of generating oncogenic mutations without first having large populations of dysregulated cells, however, suggests that pathogens, particularly viruses, are major initiators of oncogenesis for many if not most cancers, and that the traditional mutation-driven process becomes the dominant process after this initiation.

One gap in this knowledge concerns respiratory tract pathogens transmitted from person to person by direct contact or through environmental contamination. The sit-and-wait hypothesis predicts that virulence should be positively correlated with durability in the external environment because high durability reduces the dependence of transmission on host mobility. Reviewing the epidemiological and medical literature, we confirm this prediction for respiratory tract pathogens of humans. Our results clearly distinguish a high-virulence high-survival group of variola (smallpox) virus, Mycobacterium. tuberculosis, Corynebacterium diphitheriae, Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and influenza virus (where all pathogens have a mean percent mortality greater than or equal to 0.01\% and mean survival time > 10 days) from a low-virulence low-survival group containing ten other pathogens. The correlation between virulence and durability explains three to four times of magnitude of difference in mean percent mortality and mean survival time, using both across-species and phylogenetically controlled analyses. Our findings bear on several areas of active research and public health policy: (1) many pathogens used in the biological control of insects are potential sit-and-wait pathogens as they combine three attributes that are advantageous for pest control: high virulence, long durability after application, and host specificity; (2) emerging pathogens such as the 'hospital superbug' methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and potential bio-weapons pathogens such as smallpox virus and anthrax that are particularly dangerous can be discerned by quantifying their durability; (3) hospital settings and the AIDS pandemic may provide footholds for emerging sit-and-wait pathogens; and (4) studies on food-borne and insect pathogens point to future research considering the potential evolutionary trade-offs and genetic linkages between virulence and durability.},

Although some studies from the mid-20th century reported associations between certain pathogens and schizophrenia, only recently has the possibility of infectious causation of schizophrenia again become an active focus of research. Infectious causation of schizophrenia is still, however, generally regarded as less well demonstrated than genetic causation. This article evaluates the evidence that has been used to support genetic and infectious causation. Our consideration of infectious causation focuses on the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii but also assesses other pathogens that may contribute to the development of some of the illnesses currently categorized as schizophrenia. Although evidence generally accepted as demonstrating genetic causation can be readily explained by hypotheses of infectious causation, some of the evidence implicating infectious causation cannot be similarly explained by genetic causation. This asymmetry indicates that a scientific approach to the causation of schizophrenia needs to put a greater emphasis on tests that distinguish hypotheses of genetic causation from those of infectious causation.},

	abstract    = {Helicobacter pylori has apparently colonized the human stomach since time immemorial and is superbly adapted for persistence. Several genotypes, including cag(+), are associated with increased risk of gastric and duodenal diseases. With modern life, for probably the first time in human history, there are large numbers of noncolonized persons. Duodenal ulceration has been present essentially for only 200 years; that its incidence rose just as H. pylori was waning is best explained by changes in gastric microecology. As H. pylori is disappearing, duodenal ulceration and gastric cancer rates are falling. However, more proximal diseases, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), Barrett's esophagus, and adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia and lower esophagus, are increasing; colonization with cag(+) N. pylori strains appears protective against these diseases. Thus, in the 21st century, the continuing decline in H. pylori may lead to the disappearance of duodenal ulcers and distal gastric cancers and toward a marked increase in GERD, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma.},

Their ability to eliminate huge numbers of mosquitoes allows them to swiftly interrupt disease transmission, but that lethality also imposes immense selection for insecticide resistance. Targeting control at the small portion of the mosquito population actually responsible for transmitting malaria parasites to humans would reduce selection for resistance, yet maintain effective malaria control. Here, we ask whether simply lowering the concentration of the active ingredient in insecticide formulations could preferentially kill mosquitoes infected with malaria and/or those that are potentially infectious, namely, old mosquitoes. Using modified WHO resistance-monitoring assays, we exposed uninfected Anopheles stephensi females to low concentrations of the pyrethroid permethrin at days 4, 8, 12, and 16 days post-emergence and monitored survival for at least 30 days to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of repeated exposure as mosquitoes aged. We also exposed Plasmodium chabaudiand P. yoelii-infected An. stephensi females. Permethrin exposure did not consistently increase mosquito susceptibility to subsequent insecticide exposure, though older mosquitoes were more susceptible. A blood meal slightly improved survival after insecticide exposure; malaria infection did not detectably increase insecticide susceptibility. Exposure to low concentrations over successive feeding cycles substantially altered cohort age-structure. Our data suggest the possibility that, where high insecticide coverage can be achieved, low concentration formulations have the capacity to reduce disease transmission without the massive selection for resistance imposed by current practice.},

Drug use practices vigorously advocated as resistance management tools by professional bodies, public health agencies, and medical schools represent some of humankind's largest attempts to manage evolution. It is our contention that these practices have poor theoretical and empirical justification for a broad spectrum of diseases. For instance, rapid elimination of pathogens can reduce the probability that de novo resistance mutations occur. This idea often motivates the medical orthodoxy that patients should complete drug courses even when they no longer feel sick. Yet "radical pathogen cure" maximizes the evolutionary advantage of any resistant pathogens that are present. It could promote the very evolution it is intended to retard. The guiding principle should be to impose no more selection than is absolutely necessary. We illustrate these arguments in the context of malaria; they likely apply to a wide range of infections as well as cancer and public health insecticides. Intuition is unreliable even in simple evolutionary contexts; in a social milieu where in-host competition can radically alter the fitness costs and benefits of resistance, expert opinion will be insufficient. An evidence-based approach to resistance management is required.},

Adaptive strategies of microbes with different niches are genomically encoded: Specialists have smaller genomes than generalists, and microbes with environmental reservoirs have large accessory genomes. A shift toward a Neolithic diet increased loads of simple carbohydrates and selected for their increased breakdown and absorption in the small intestine. Humans who outcompeted microbes for the new substrates obtained more energy from their diets and prospered, an evolutionary process reflected in modern population genetics. The three-way interactions between human genetics, diet, and the microbiota fundamentally shaped modern populations and continue to affect health globally.},

Recent data on genomic analyses and comparative core genome haplotyping have revealed that H. pylori has coevolved with its human host. While several studies advocate the protective effects of H. pylori colonization, it is prudent to systematically unleash the role of the strong virulence apparatus present within most H. pylori strains and to determine how to disarm them (or protect the host from the effects) if the intent is to allow it to remain a friendly organism or to use it as a vaccine delivery tool. While genotyping and phenotyping based on a few genetic markers have not provided much insight into such issues, use of replicate/chronological genomics (of virulent versus innocuous strains) coupled with functional screens in animal models is expected to be able to explain the acquisition and evolution of virulence factors of H. pylori and their discreet associations with serious clinical outcomes such as gastric cancer.

H. pylori genes encoding these and other factors rapidly evolve through mutation and recombination, changing the bacteria-host interaction. Although immune and physiologic responses to H. pylori also contribute to pathogenesis, humans have evolved in concert with the bacterium, and its recent absence throughout the life of many individuals has led to new human physiological changes. These may have contributed to recent increases in esophageal adenocarcinoma and, more speculatively, other modern diseases.},

We examined associations between historical and contemporary pathogen prevalence and endorsement of the moral foundations via multilevel analyses. Country-level analyses showed that even when controlling for gross domestic product per capita, historical (but not contemporary) pathogen prevalence significantly predicted endorsement of the binding foundations, but not individualizing foundations. Multilevel analyses showed that this pattern held even when controlling for individual-level variation in political orientation, gender, education, and age. These results highlight the utility of a functional evolutionary approach to understanding patterns of morals across societies and individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

These explanations are based on the theories of kin selection and reciprocal altruism, and they predict that moral systems are designed to maximize Hamiltonian inclusive fitness. In sharp contrast, however, moral judgment often appears Kantian and rule-based. To reconcile this apparent discrepancy, some theorists have claimed that Kantian moral rules result from mechanisms that implement simple heuristics for maximizing welfare. To test this idea, we conducted a set of studies in which subjects (N=1290) decided whether they would kill one person to save five others, varying the relationship of the subject with the others involved (strangers, friends, brothers). Are participants more likely to observe the Kantian rule against killing in decisions about brothers and friends, rather than strangers? We found the reverse. Subjects reported greater willingness to kill a brother or friend than a stranger (in order to save five others of the same type). These results suggest that the rule-based structure of moral cognition is not explained by kin selection, reciprocity, or other altruism theories. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This approach hypothesizes a norm-psychology: a suite of psychological adaptations for inferring, encoding in memory, adhering to, enforcing and redressing violations of the shared behavioral standards of one's community. After reviewing the substantial body of formal theory underpinning these predictions, we outline how this account organizes diverse empirical findings in the cognitive sciences and related disciplines.

Drawing from two subject populations-one undergraduate and one Internet-based-we look at the relationships among (i) abstract political commitments; (ii) attitudes about sexuality; and (iii) views surrounding recreational drugs. Whereas some theories suggest that drug views are best understood as the result of abstract political ideology, we suggest that these views can be better understood in the context of reproductive strategy. We show that, as predicted by a strategic construal, drug attitudes are best predicted by sexual items rather than abstract political commitments and, further, that the relationship between factors such as political ideology and drugs, while positive, are reduced to zero or nearly zero when items assessing sexuality are controlled for. We conclude that considering morality from the standpoint of strategic interests is a potentially useful way to understand why humans care about third party behaviour.},

We propose that reactive prosocial acts reflect sensitivity to (i) signals or signs of need and (ii) the presence and size of an audience, as modified by (iii) social distance to the partner or partners. We examine the evidence for these elements in humans and other animals, especially non-human primates, based on the natural history of cooperation, quantified in the context of food sharing, and various experimental paradigms. The comparison suggests that humans share with their closest living relatives reactive responses to signals of need, but differ in sensitivity to signs of need and cues of being watched, as well as in the presence of proactive prosociality. We discuss ultimate explanations for these derived features, in particular the adoption of cooperative breeding as well as concern for reputation and costly signalling during human evolution.},

More generally, these accounts have concentrated on conscience (self-regulatory mechanisms) to the neglect of condemnation (mechanisms for punishing others). As a result, few theoretical tools are available for understanding the rapidly accumulating data surrounding third-party judgment and punishment. Here we consider the strategic interactions among actors, victims, and third-parties to help illuminate condemnation. We argue that basic differences between the adaptive problems faced by actors and third-parties indicate that actor conscience and third-party condemnation are likely performed by different cognitive mechanisms. Further, we argue that current theories of conscience do not easily explain its experimentally demonstrated insensitivity to consequences. However, these results might be explicable if conscience functions, in part, as a defense system for avoiding third-party punishment. If conscience serves defensive functions, then its computational structure should be closely tailored to the details of condemnation mechanisms. This possibility underscores the need for a better understanding of condemnation, which is important not only in itself but also for explaining the nature of conscience. We outline three evolutionary mysteries of condemnation that require further attention: third-party judgment, moralistic punishment, and moral impartiality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This is particularly important for a large class of moral norms relating to rapidly changing technological or social environments, such as norms regarding the acceptability of genetically modified organisms. Here we suggest that a science of morality/ethics can benefit from adopting a cultural evolution or gene-culture coevolution approach, which treats culture as a second, separate evolutionary system that acts in parallel to biological/genetic evolution. This cultural evolution approach brings with it a set of established theoretical concepts (e.g. different cultural transmission mechanisms) and empirical methods (e.g. evolutionary game theory) that can significantly improve our understanding of human morality.},

The algorithm is iterative, a quadratic model Q \u2248 F being required at the beginning of each iteration, which is used in a trust region procedure for adjusting the variables. When Q is revised, the new Q interpolates F at m points, the value m = 2 n + 1 being recommended. The remaining freedom in the new Q is taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to \u2207 2 Q . Only one interpolation point is altered on each iteration. Thus, except for occasional origin shifts, the amount of work per iteration is only of order ( m + n ) 2 , which allows n to be quite large. Many questions were addressed during the development of NEWUOA, for the achievement of good accuracy and robustness. They include the choice of the initial quadratic model, the need to maintain enough linear independence in the interpolation conditions in the presence of computer rounding errors, and the stability of the updating of certain matrices that allow the fast revision of Q . Details are given of the techniques that answer all the questions that occurred. The software was tried on several test problems. Numerical results for nine of them are reported and discussed, in order to demonstrate the performance of the software for up to 160 variables.},

	abstract    = {The genetic basis of gene expression variation has long been studied with the aim to understand the landscape of regulatory variants, but also more recently to assist in the interpretation and elucidation of disease signals. To date, many studies have looked in specific tissues and population-based samples, but there has been limited assessment of the degree of inter-population variability in regulatory variation. We analyzed genome-wide gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a total of 726 individuals from 8 global populations from the HapMap3 project and correlated gene expression levels with HapMap3 SNPs located in cis to the genes. We describe the influence of ancestry on gene expression levels within and between these diverse human populations and uncover a non-negligible impact on global patterns of gene expression. We further dissect the specific functional pathways differentiated between populations. We also identify 5,691 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) after controlling for both non-genetic factors and population admixture and observe that half of the cis-eQTLs are replicated in one or more of the populations. We highlight patterns of eQTL-sharing between populations, which are partially determined by population genetic relatedness, and discover significant sharing of eQTL effects between Asians, European-admixed, and African subpopulations. Specifically, we observe that both the effect size and the direction of effect for eQTLs are highly conserved across populations. We observe an increasing proximity of eQTLs toward the transcription start site as sharing of eQTLs among populations increases, highlighting that variants close to TSS have stronger effects and therefore are more likely to be detected across a wider panel of populations. Together these results offer a unique picture and resource of the degree of differentiation among human populations in functional regulatory variation and provide an estimate for the transferability of complex trait variants across populations.},

	abstract    = {The human mutation rate per nucleotide site per generation (mu) can be estimated from data on mutation rates at loci causing Mendelian genetic disease, by comparing putatively neutrally evolving nucleotide sequences between humans and chimpanzees and by comparing the genome sequences of relatives. Direct estimates from genome sequencing of relatives suggest that mu is about 1.1 x 10(-8), which is about twofold lower than estimates based on the human-chimp divergence. This implies that an average of similar to 70 new mutations arise in the human diploid genome per generation. Most of these mutations are paternal in origin, but the male: female mutation rate ratio is currently uncertain and might vary even among individuals within a population. On the basis of a method proposed by Kondrashov and Crow, the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate (U) can be estimated from the product of the number of nucleotide sites in the genome, mu, and the mean selective constraint per site. Although the presence of many weakly selected mutations in human noncoding DNA makes this approach somewhat problematic, estimates are U approximate to 2.2 for the whole diploid genome per generation and similar to 0.35 for mutations that change an amino acid of a protein-coding gene. A genome-wide deleterious mutation rate of 2.2 seems higher than humans could tolerate if natural selection is "hard," but could be tolerated if selection acts on relative fitness differences between individuals or if there is synergistic epistasis. I argue that in the foreseeable future, an accumulation of new deleterious mutations is unlikely to lead to a detectable decline in fitness of human populations.},

We introduce a novel method for the analysis of variation in selection pressures within and between species, spatially along the genome and temporally between lineages. We model codon evolution explicitly using a joint population genetics-phylogenetics approach that we developed for the construction of multiallelic models with mutation, selection, and drift. Our approach has the advantage of performing direct inference on coding sequences, inferring ancestral states probabilistically, utilizing allele frequency information, and generalizing to multiple species. We use a Bayesian sliding window model for intragenic variation in selection coefficients that efficiently combines information across sites and captures spatial clustering within the genome. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we infer selective pressures acting in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans from polymorphism and divergence data for 100 X-linked coding regions.},

Here, we describe how complex machines might instead evolve in the absence of positive selection through a process of "presuppression," first termed constructive neutral evolution (CNE) more than a decade ago. If an autonomously functioning cellular component acquires mutations that make it dependent for function on another, preexisting component or process, and if there are multiple ways in which such dependence may arise, then dependence inevitably will arise and reversal to independence is unlikely. Thus, CNE is a unidirectional evolutionary ratchet leading to complexity, if complexity is equated with the number of components or steps necessary to carry out a cellular process. CNE can explain "functions" that seem to make little sense in terms of cellular economy, like RNA editing or splicing, but it may also contribute to the complexity of machines with clear benefit to the cell, like the ribosome, and to organismal complexity overall. We suggest that CNE-based evolutionary scenarios are in these and other cases less forced than the selectionist or adaptationist narratives that are generally told.

Surveys of population structure have been ongoing for decades, but in the past three years, single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) array technology has provided unprecedented detail on human population structure at global and regional scales. These studies have confirmed well-known relationships between distantly related populations and uncovered previously unresolvable relationships among closely related human groups. SNPs represent the first dense genome-wide markers, and as such, their analysis has raised many challenges and insights relevant to the study of population genetics with whole-genome sequences.

A variety of statistical methods has been developed for detecting natural selection operating at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence levels. These methods may be largely classified into those aimed at detecting recurrent and/or recent/ongoing natural selection by utilizing the divergence and/or polymorphism data. Using these methods, pervasive positive selection has been identified for protein-coding and non-coding sequences in the genomic analysis of some organisms. However, many of these methods have been criticized by using computer simulation and real data analysis to produce excessive false-positives and to be sensitive to various disturbing factors. Importantly, some of these methods have been invalidated experimentally. These facts indicate that many of the statistical methods for detecting natural selection are unreliable. In addition, the signals that have been believed as the evidence for fixations of advantageous mutations due to positive selection may also be interpreted as the evidence for fixations of deleterious mutations due to random genetic drift. The genomic diversity data are rapidly accumulating in various organisms, and detection of natural selection may play a critical role for clarifying the relative role of random genetic drift and positive selection in molecular and phenotypic evolution. It is therefore important to develop reliable statistical methods that are unbiased as well as robust against various disturbing factors, for inferring natural selection.},

Human disease studies have identified several hundred haploinsufficient (HI) genes. We have compiled a map of 1,079 haplosufficient (HS) genes by systematic identification of genes unambiguously and repeatedly compromised by copy number variation among 8,458 apparently healthy individuals and contrasted the genomic, evolutionary, functional, and network properties between these HS genes and known HI genes. We found that HI genes are typically longer and have more conserved coding sequences and promoters than HS genes. HI genes exhibit higher levels of expression during early development and greater tissue specificity. Moreover, within a probabilistic human functional interaction network HI genes have more interaction partners and greater network proximity to other known HI genes. We built a predictive model on the basis of these differences and annotated 12,443 genes with their predicted probability of being haploinsufficient. We validated these predictions of haploinsufficiency by demonstrating that genes with a high predicted probability of exhibiting haploinsufficiency are enriched among genes implicated in human dominant diseases and among genes causing abnormal phenotypes in heterozygous knockout mice. We have transformed these gene-based haploinsufficiency predictions into haploinsufficiency scores for genic deletions, which we demonstrate to better discriminate between pathogenic and benign deletions than consideration of the deletion size or numbers of genes deleted. These robust predictions of haploinsufficiency support clinical interpretation of novel loss-of-function variants and prioritization of variants and genes for follow-up studies.},

The latter view has received renewed attention, yet its implications for evolutionary causation still are not widely understood. We review theoretical results showing that this conception of evolution allows for a role of mutation as a cause of nonrandomness, a role that could be important but has been misconceived and associated misleadingly with neutral evolution. Specifically, biases in the introduction of variation, including mutational biases, may impose predictable biases on evolution, with no necessary dependence on neutrality. As an example of how important such effects may be, we present a new analysis partitioning the variance in mean rates of amino acid replacement during human-chimpanzee divergence to components of codon mutation and amino acid exchangeability. The results indicate that mutational effects are not merely important but account for most of the variance explained. The challenge that such results pose for comparative genomics is to address mutational effects as a necessary part of any analysis of causal factors. To meet this challenge requires developing knowledge of mutation as a biological process, understanding how mutation imposes propensities on evolution, and applying methods of analysis that incorporate mutational effects.},

Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29\% of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (vertical bar s vertical bar < 0.01\%), 30-42\% are moderately deleterious (0.01\%, vertical bar s vertical bar, 1\%), and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal (vertical bar s vertical bar. 1\%). Our results are consistent with 10-20\% of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.},

Nevertheless, there are examples of polygenic traits that are bound to be under selection, but studies devoted to apply population genetics methods to unveil such occurrence are still lacking. Stature provides a relevant example of well-studied polygenic trait for which is now available a genome-wide association study which has identified the genes involved in this trait, and which is known to be under selection. We studied the behavior of F(ST) in a simulated toy model to detect population differentiation on a generic polygenic phenotype under selection. The simulations showed that the set of alleles involved in the trait has a higher mean FST value than those undergoing genetic drift only. In view of this we looked for an increase in the mean FST value of the 180 variants associated to human height. For this set of alleles we found F(ST) to be significantly higher than the genomic background (p = 0.0356). On the basis of a statistical analysis we excluded that the increase was just due to the presence of outliers. We also proved as marginal the role played by local adaptation phenomena, even on different phenotypes in linkage disequilibrium with genetic variants involved in height. The increase of F(ST) for the set of alleles involved in a polygenic trait seems to provide an example of symmetry breaking phenomenon concerning the population differentiation. The splitting in the allele frequencies would be driven by the initial conditions in the population dynamics which are stochastically modified by events like drift, bottlenecks, etc, and other stochastic events like the born of new mutations.},

In this review, I describe evidence that suggests that primate and human evolution has been strongly influenced by nonadaptive processes, particularly random genetic drift and mutation. This is evidenced by three fundamental effects: a relative relaxation of selective constraints (i.e., purifying selection), a relative increase in the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations, and a general reduction in the efficacy of positive selection. These effects are observed in protein-coding, regulatory regions, and in gene expression data, as well as in an augmentation of fixation of large-scale mutations, including duplicated genes, mobile genetic elements, and nuclear mitochondrial DNA. The evidence suggests a general population-level explanation such as a reduction in effective population size (Ne). This would have tipped the balance between the evolutionary forces of natural selection and random genetic drift toward genetic drift for variants having small selective effects. After describing these proximate effects, I describe the potential consequences of these effects for primate and human evolution. For example, an increase in the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations could potentially have led to an increase in the fixation rate of compensatory mutations that act to suppress the effects of slightly deleterious substitutions. The potential consequences of compensatory evolution for the evolution of novel gene functions and in potentially confounding the detection of positively selected genes are explored. The consequences of the passive accumulation of large-scale genomic mutations by genetic drift are unclear, though evidence suggests that new gene copies as well as insertions of transposable elements into genes can potentially lead to adaptive phenotypes. Finally, because a decrease in selective constraint at the genetic level is expected to have effects at the morphological level, I review studies that compare rates of morphological change in various mammalian and island populations where Ne is reduced. Furthermore, I discuss evidence that suggests that craniofacial morphology in the Homo lineage has shifted from an evolutionary rate constrained by purifying selection toward a neutral evolutionary rate.

Most of the genetic differentiation among populations are caused by random drift that should affect all loci across the genome in a similar manner. When a locus shows extraordinary high or low levels of population differentiation, this may be interpreted as evidence for natural selection. The most used measure of population differentiation was devised by Wright and is known as fixation index, or F(ST). We performed a genome-wide estimation of F(ST) on about 4 millions of SNPs from HapMap project data. We demonstrated a heterogeneous distribution of F(ST) values between autosomes and heterochromosomes. When we compared the F(ST) values obtained in this study with another evolutionary measure obtained by comparative interspecific approach, we found that genes under positive selection appeared to show low levels of population differentiation. We applied a gene set approach, widely used for microarray data analysis, to detect functional pathways under selection. We found that one pathway related to antigen processing and presentation showed low levels of F(ST), while several pathways related to cell signalling, growth and morphogenesis showed high F(ST) values. Finally, we detected a signature of selection within genes associated with human complex diseases. These results can help to identify which process occurred during human evolution and adaptation to different environments. They also support the hypothesis that common diseases could have a genetic background shaped by human evolution.},

We find that the average allele frequency divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme F(ST) values across the whole genome. On a broad scale, the geographic distribution of putatively selected alleles almost invariably conforms to population clusters identified using randomly chosen genetic markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human populations. Among the nearly fixed differences that do exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that occurred outside of Africa, and most appear in East Asia. These patterns suggest that selection is often weak enough that neutral processes-especially population history, migration, and drift exert powerful influences over the fate and geographic distribution of selected alleles.},

	abstract    = {There is a class of theories of aging (variously termed adaptive aging, aging by design, aging selected for its own sake, or programmed death theories) that hold that an organism design that limits life span conveys benefits and was selected specifically because it limits life span. These theories have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity because of the discovery of genes that promote aging in various organisms. However, traditional evolution theory has a core tenet that excludes the possibility of evolving and retaining an individually adverse organism design, i.e. a design characteristic that reduces the ability of individual organisms to survive or reproduce without any compensating individual benefit. Various theories of aging dating from the 1950s and based on traditional evolution theory enjoy substantial popularity. Therefore. any theorist proposing an adaptive theory of aging must necessarily also propose some adjustment to traditional evolution theory that specifically addresses the individual benefit issue. This paper describes an adaptive theory of aging and describes how one of the proposed adjustments (evolvability theory) supports adaptive aging. This issue is important because adaptive theories are generally more optimistic regarding prospects for medical intervention in the aging process and also suggest different approaches in achieving such intervention.

	abstract    = {Starting with "mitochondrial Eve" in 1987, genetics has played an increasingly important role in studies of the last two million years of human evolution. It initially appeared that genetic data resolved the basic models of recent human evolution in favor of the "out-of-Africa replacement" hypothesis in which anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa about 150,000 years ago, started to spread throughout the world about 100,000 years ago, and subsequently drove to complete genetic extinction (replacement) all other human populations in Eurasia. Unfortunately, many of the genetic studies on recent human evolution have suffered from scientific flaws, including misrepresenting the models of recent human evolution, focusing upon hypothesis compatibility rather than hypothesis testing, committing the ecological fallacy, and failing to consider a broader array of alternative hypotheses. Once these flaws are corrected, there is actually little genetic support for the out-of-Africa replacement hypothesis. Indeed, when genetic data are used in a hypothesis-testing framework, the out-of-Africa replacement hypothesis is strongly rejected. The model of recent human evolution that emerges from a statistical hypothesis-testing framework does not correspond to any of the traditional models of human evolution, but it is compatible with fossil and archaeological data. These studies also reveal that any one gene or DNA region captures only a small part of human evolutionary history, so multilocus studies are essential. As more and more loci became available, genetics will undoubtedly offer additional insights and resolutions of human evolution.},

However, the evaluation of multiple omega(i) within a phylogenetic tree can easily inflate the statistical type I error rate. We developed two rigorous methods of analysis that avoid this and other potential pitfalls. We applied these methods to four published examples of adaptive evolution. One case was strongly supported by our reanalysis (abalone sperm lysin), and one was weakly supported (baboon alpha-globin), but two examples (primate lysozyme and Antarctic fish beta-globin) did not show significant evidence of adaptive evolution. Our first method is a "bottom-up" hierarchical maximum likelihood approach, which (1) tests for significant heterogeneity in omega across the phylogeny, (2) locates its source using a sequence of planned comparisons, and (3) tests homogeneous groups of omega for omega > 1, using a modified level of significance that incorporates the pretesting. The second method is a "top-down" log-linear analysis based on estimates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions in pairs of lineages. The log-linear test is applied to pairs of lineages joined at progressively deeper nodes. For each pair, the analysis simultaneously tests for adaptive evolution (omega > 1), a shift in natural selection (omega(1) not equal omega(2)), and unequal evolution rate (the relative rate test). In both tests, we emphasized that the criterion omega(1) not equal omega(2) is an important additional indicator of a phylogenetic shift in the balance between natural selection and genetic drift between two related lineages.},

Directions of anti-aging research could be significantly influenced by basic theories of aging. Weismann proposed in 1882 that aging was an evolved genetically programmed adaptation that had a species benefit. Since then this idea has been largely replaced by various theories in which aging is not an adaptation but results from accumulated adverse mutations or is an adverse side effect of some essential process. Arguments are presented to the effect that aging is an evolved beneficial characteristic and is therefore likely to result from a more complex and structured mechanism than if it resulted from more random processes such as mutation accumulation. Further, aging appears to be one of a number of related and interactive tife-cycle characteristics including age-at-puberty suggesting that it might be controlled by similar biological mechanisms.

Evolutionary models involving early admixture are compatible with the data.	Taking one such model into account, we examined through simulation whether random genetic drift alone might explain the variation among gene frequencies across populations and genes.	A measure of variation among populations was calculated for each polymorphism, and its distribution for the 100 polymorphisms was compared with that expected for a drift-only hypothesis.  At least two-thirds of the polymorphisms appear to be selectively neutral, but there are significant deviations at the two ends of the observed distribution of the measure of variation:  a slight excess of polymorphisms with low variation and a greater excess with high variation.  This indicates that a few DNA polymorphisms are affected by natural selection, rarely heterotic, and more often disruptive, while most are selectively neutral.},

Through the analysis of more than 500 genomes, we identify two kingdom-specific tRNA modifications as major contributors that separated archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal genomes in terms of their tRNA gene composition. We show that, contrary to prior observations, genomic codon usage and tRNA gene frequencies correlate in all kingdoms if these two modifications are taken into account and that presence or absence of these modifications explains patterns of gene expression observed in previous studies. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that human gene expression levels correlate well with genomic codon composition if these identified modifications are considered.},

We suggest new means to model the process of translation in a richer framework that will incorporate information about gene sequences, the tRNA pool of the organism and the thermodynamic stability of the mRNA transcripts. A practical demonstration of a better understanding of the process would be a more accurate prediction of the proteome, given the transcriptome at a diversity of biological conditions.

Across the genome, genes evolve at very different rates and possess markedly varying levels of molecular polymorphism, codon bias and expression variation. Discovering the underlying causes of this variation has been a challenge in evolutionary biology. It has been proposed that both the intrinsic properties of enzymes and their pathway position have direct effects on their molecular evolution, and with the genomic era the study of adaptation has been taken to the level of pathways and networks of genes and their products. Of special interest have been the energy-producing pathways. Using both population genetic and experimental approaches, our laboratory has been engaged in a study of molecular variation across the glycolytic pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives. We have observed a pervasive pattern in which genes at the top of the pathway, especially around the intersection at glucose 6-phosphate, show evidence for both contemporary selection, in the form of latitudinal allele clines, and inter-specific selection, in the form of elevated levels of amino acid substitutions between species. To further explore this question, future work will require corroboration in other species, expansion into tangential pathways, and experimental work to better characterize metabolic control through the pathway and to examine the pleiotropic effects of these genes on other traits and fitness components.},

Selection pressures related to these biophysical processes affect primarily the amino-acid sequence of genes, but they also leave their mark on synonymous sites at the nucleotide level. While evidence for specific selection pressures related to protein biophysics is strong, there is currently no unifying framework that integrates the various selection pressures on coding sequences and disentangles their relative importance.},

These patterns have been inferred to reflect the action of natural selection. Here we evaluate this in bacteria. While intragenomic variation in many species is consistent with selection favouring translationally optimal codons, much of the variation among species appears to be due to biased patterns of mutation. The strength of selection on codon usage can be estimated by two different approaches. First, the extent of bias in favour of translationally optimal codons in highly expressed genes, compared to that in genes where selection is weak, reveals the long-term effectiveness of selection. Here we show that the strength of selected codon usage bias is highly correlated with bacterial growth rate, suggesting that selection has favoured translational efficiency. Second, the pattern of bias towards optimal codons at polymorphic sites reveals the ongoing action of selection. Using this approach we obtained results that were completely consistent with the first method; importantly, the frequency spectra of optimal codons at polymorphic sites were similar to those predicted under an equilibrium model. Highly expressed genes in Escherichia coli appear to be under continuing strong selection, whereas selection is very weak in genes expressed at low levels.},

However, cumulative evidence suggests that synonymous substitutions might also induce phenotypic variability by affecting splicing accuracy, translation fidelity, and conformation and function of proteins. tRNA isoacceptors mediate the translation of codons to amino acids, and asymmetric tRNA abundance causes variations in the rate of translation of each single triplet. Consequently, the effect of a silent point mutation in the coding region could be significant due to differential abundances of the cognate tRNA(s), emphasizing the importance of precise assessment of tRNA composition. Here, we provide an overview of the methods used to quantitatively determine the concentrations of tRNA species and discuss synonymous mutations in the context of tRNA composition of the cell, thus providing a new twist on the detrimental impact of the silent mutations.},

The fidelity of translation is mainly determined by two events: synthesis of cognate amino acid: tRNA pairs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and accurate selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) by the ribosome. To ensure faithful aa-tRNA synthesis, many aaRSs employ a proofreading ("editing") activity, such as phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) that hydrolyze mischarged Tyr-tRNA(Phe). Eukaryotes maintain two distinct PheRS enzymes, a cytoplasmic (ctPheRS) and an organellar form. CtPheRS is similar to bacterial enzymes in that it consists of a heterotetramer in which the alpha-subunits contain the active site and the beta-subunits harbor the editing site. In contrast, mitochondrial PheRS (mtPheRS) is an alpha-subunit monomer that does not edit Tyr-tRNA(Phe), and a comparable transacting activity does not exist in organelles. Although mtPheRS does not edit, it is extremely specific as only one Tyr-tRNA(Phe) is synthesized for every similar to 7; 300 Phe-tRNA(Phe), compatible with an error rate in translation of similar to 10(-4). When the error rate of mtPheRS was increased 17-fold, the corresponding strain could not grow on respiratory media and the mitochondrial genome was rapidly lost. In contrast, error-prone mtPheRS, editing-deficient ctPheRS, and their wildtype counterparts all supported cytoplasmic protein synthesis and cell growth. These striking differences reveal unexpectedly divergent requirements for quality control in different cell compartments and suggest that the limits of translational accuracy may be largely determined by cellular physiology.

Thus, in each step the ribosome moves forward by one codon and, simultaneously, elongates the protein by one amino acid. We present a theoretical model that captures most of the main steps in the mechanochemical cycle of a ribosome. The stochastic movement of the ribosome consists of an alternating sequence of pause and translocation; the sum of the durations of a pause and the following translocation is the time of dwell of the ribosome at the corresponding codon. We derive the analytical expression for the distribution of the dwell times of a ribosome in our model. Wherever experimental data are available, our theoretical predictions are consistent with those results. We suggest appropriate experiments to test the new predictions of our model, particularly the effects of the quality control mechanism of the ribosome and that of their crowding on the mRNA track.},

The ribosomes bound simultaneously to a single mRNA transcript are the members of a polyribosome (or, simply, polysome). Experimentally measured polysome profile gives the distribution of polysome sizes. Recently a breakthrough in determining the instantaneous positions of the ribosomes on a given mRNA track has been achieved and the technique is called ribosome profiling (Ingolia et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2010). Motivated by the success of these techniques, we have studied the spatio-temporal organization of ribosomes by extending a theoretical model that we have reported elsewhere (Sharma and Chowdhury, 2011). This extended version of our model incorporates not only (i) mechano-chemical cycle of individual ribomes, and (ii) their steric interactions, but also (iii) the effects of (a) kinetic proofreading, (b) translational infidelity, (c) ribosome recycling, and (d) sequence inhomogeneities. The theoretical framework developed here will serve in guiding further experiments and in analyzing the data to gain deep insight into various kinetic processes involved in translation.

However, both the magnitude and the mechanisms of codon-mediated effects are unknown, as neither the effects of individual codons nor the parameters that modulate codon-mediated regulation are understood, particularly in eukaryotes. To explore this problem in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we performed the first systematic analysis of codon effects on expression. We find that the arginine codon CGA is strongly inhibitory, resulting in progressively and sharply reduced expression with increased CGA codon dosage. CGA-mediated inhibition of expression is primarily due to wobble decoding of CGA, since it is nearly completely suppressed by coexpression of an exact match anticodon-mutated tRNA Arg(UCG), and is associated with generation of a smaller RNA fragment, likely due to endonucleolytic cleavage at a stalled ribosome. Moreover, CGA codon pairs are more effective inhibitors of expression than individual CGA codons. These results directly implicate decoding by the ribosome and interactions at neighboring sites within the ribosome as mediators of codon-specific translation efficiency.

Here, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of tRNA selection in the context of a mismatched P-site codon: anticodon interaction. We observe pleiotropic effects of a P-site mismatch on tRNA selection, such that near-cognate tRNA is processed by the ribosome almost as efficiently as cognate. In particular, after a miscoding event, near-cognate codon-anticodon complexes are stabilized on the ribosome to an extent similar to that observed for cognate ones. Moreover, the two observed forward rates of GTPase activation and accommodation are greatly accelerated (similar to 10-fold)for nearcognatet RNAs. Because the ensemble of effects of a mismatched P site on substrate selection were found to be different from those reported for other ribosomal perturbations and miscoding agents, we propose that the structural integrity of the mRNA-tRNA helix in the P site provides a distinct molecular switch that dictates the specificity of the A site.},

There is a significant influence of the 37-modification by itself on the P-site, whereas there is no such one on the A-site of the ribosome. Comparison of binding enthalpies of tRNA interactions on the P- or A-site of the ribosome with the binding enthalpies of the complex of two tRNAs with the complementary anticodones suggests that the ribosome by itself significantly endows in the thermodynamics of codon-anticodon complex formation. It happens by additional ribosomal interactions with the molecule of tRNA or indirectly by the stabilization of codon-anticodon conformation. In addition to the stacking, tRNA binding in the A and P sites is futher stabilized by the interactions involving some magnesium ions. The number of them involved in those interactions strongly depends on the nucleotide identity in the 37-position of tRNA anticodon loop.

We describe the fast and simple All-Codon Scanning (ACS) strategy that creates a defined gene library wherein each individual codon within a specific target region is changed into all possible codons with only a single codon change per mutagenesis product. ACS is based on a multiplexed overlapping mutagenesis primer design that saturates only the targeted gene region with single codon changes. We have used ACS to produce single amino-acid changes in small and large regions of the human tumor suppressor protein p53 to identify single amino-acid substitutions that can restore activity to inactive p53 found in human cancers. Single-tube reactions were used to saturate defined 30-nt regions with all possible codon changes. The same technique was used in 20 parallel reactions to scan the 600-bp fragment encoding the entire p53 core domain. Identification of several novel p53 cancer rescue mutations demonstrated the utility of the ACS approach. ACS is a fast, simple and versatile method, which is useful for protein structure-function analyses and protein design or evolution problems.},

In order to identify general rules that shape codon-pair context and minimize mRNA decoding error, we have carried out a large scale comparative codon-pair context analysis of 119 fully sequenced genomes. Methodologies/Principal Findings. We have developed mathematical and software tools for large scale comparative codon-pair context analysis. These methodologies unveiled general and species specific codon-pair context rules that govern evolution of mRNAs in the 3 domains of life. We show that evolution of bacterial and archeal mRNA primary structure is mainly dependent on constraints imposed by the translational machinery, while in eukaryotes DNA methylation and tri-nucleotide repeats impose strong biases on codon-pair context. Conclusions. The data highlight fundamental differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic mRNA decoding rules, which are partially independent of codon usage.

A comparative annotation of these genomes identified a near extinction of transposons and the associated innovation of transposon-free centromeres. Expression analysis established that meiotic genes are subject to antisense transcription during vegetative growth, which suggests a mechanism for their tight regulation. In addition, trans-acting regulators control new genes within the context of expanded functional modules for meiosis and stress response. Differences in gene content and regulation also explain why, unlike the budding yeast of Saccharomycotina, fission yeasts cannot use ethanol as a primary carbon source. These analyses elucidate the genome structure and gene regulation of fission yeast and provide tools for investigation across the Schizosaccharomyces clade.

A striking feature of these repeats is that they maintain a high level of inter-repeat sequence identity within the centromere. This observation is suggestive of a recombination mechanism that operates at centromeres. Here we postulate that inter-repeat homologous recombination plays an intrinsic role in centromere function by forming covalently closed DNA loops. Moreover, the model provides an explanation of why both inverted and direct repeats are maintained and how they contribute to centromere function.

This has prompted exploration of other genomic and chromatin features to gain an understanding of where CENP-A is deposited. In this review we highlight recent papers that advance our understanding of how the cell builds a centromere. We focus on what influences the choice of site for CENP-A deposition and therefore the site of centromere formation. We then briefly discuss how centromeres are propagated once the site of centromere assembly is chosen.

We show that centromere mitotic recombination occurs in normal cells to a higher frequency than telomere recombination and to a much higher frequency than chromosome-arm recombination. Furthermore, we show that centromere mitotic recombination is increased in cells lacking the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b DNA methyltransferases, suggesting that the epigenetic state of centromeric heterochromatin controls recombination events at these regions. Increased centromere recombination in Dnmt3a, 3b-deficient cells is accompanied by changes in the length of centromere repeats, suggesting that prevention of illicit centromere recombination is important to maintain centromere integrity in the mouse.},

Heterochromatin is frequently found near CENP-A chromatin, which is the key determinant of kinetochore assembly. We have discovered that the RNA interference ( RNAi)- directed heterochromatin flanking the central kinetochore domain at fission yeast centromeres is required to promote CENPA(Cnp1) and kinetochore assembly over the central domain. The H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 ( Suv39); the ribonuclease Dicer, which cleaves heterochromatic double- stranded RNA to small interfering RNA ( siRNA); Chp1, a component of the RNAi effector complex ( RNA- induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing; RITS); and Swi6 ( HP1) are required to establish CENP-A(Cnp1) chromatin on naive templates. Once assembled, CENP-A(Cnp1) chromatin is propagated by epigenetic means in the absence of heterochromatin. Thus, another, potentially conserved, role for centromeric RNAi- directed heterochromatin has been identified.

In several organisms, including the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the RNAi pathway contributes to the formation of silent chromatin in pericentromeric regions. Little is known about how chromatin-remodeling factors contribute to heterochromatic integrity and centromere function. Here we show that the histone chaperone and remodeling complex FACT is required for centromeric-heterochromatin integrity and accurate chromosome segregation. We show that Spt16 and Pob3 are two subunits of the S. pombe FACT complex. Surprisingly, yeast strains deleted for pob3+ are viable and alleviate gene silencing at centromeric repeats and at the silent mating-type locus. Importantly, like heterochromatin and RNAi pathway mutants, Pob3 null strains exhibit lagging chromosomes on anaphase spindles. Whereas the processing of centromeric RNA transcripts into siRNAs is maintained in Pob3 mutants, Swi6-association with the centromere is reduced. Our studies provide the first experimental evidence for a role of the RNA polymerase II cofactor FACT in heterochromatin integrity and in centromere function.},

Two features consistently distinguish centromeres: the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A and, in most organisms, the presence of heterochromatin. In fission yeast, domains of silent 'heterochromatin' flank the CENP-A chromatin domain that forms a platform upon which the kinetochore is assembled. Thus, fission yeast centromeres resemble their metazoan counterparts where the kinetochore is embedded in centromeric heterochromatin. The centromeric outer repeat chromatin is underacetylated on histories H3 and H4, and methylated on lysine 9 of histone H3, which provides a binding site for the chromodomain protein Swi6 (orthologue of Heterochromatin Protein 1, HP1). The remarkable demonstration that the assembly of repressive heterochromatin is dependent on the RNA interference machinery provokes many questions about the mechanisms of this process that may be tractable in fission yeast. Heterochromatin ensures that a high density of cohesin is recruited to centromeric regions, but it could have additional roles in centromere architecture and the prevention of merotely, and it might also act as a trigger for kinetochore assembly. In addition, we discuss an epigenetic model for ensuring that CENP-A is targeted and replenished at the kinetochore domain.

A recent study revealed the importance of the features of the interacting protein partners, viz., the coefficient of functionality and clustering coefficient in controlling the protein evolutionary rates in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results: By multivariate regression analysis we found that the three parameters: probability of complex formation, expression level and degree of a protein independently guide the evolutionary rates of proteins in the PPI network. The contribution of the complex forming property of a protein and its expression level led to nearly 43\% of the total variation as observed from the first principal component. We also found that for complex forming proteins in the network, those which have partners sharing the same functional class evolve faster than those having partners belonging to different functional classes. The proteins in the dense parts of the network evolve faster than their counterparts which are present in the sparse regions of the network. Taking into account the complex forming ability, we found that all the complex forming proteins considered in this study evolve slower than the noncomplex forming proteins irrespective of their localization in the network or the affiliation of their partners to same/different functional classes.
	  Conclusions: We have shown here that the functionality and clustering coefficient correlated with the degree of the protein in the protein-protein interaction network. We have identified the significant relationship of the complex-forming property of proteins and their evolutionary rates even when they are classified according to the features of their interacting partners. Our study implies that the evolutionarily constrained proteins are actually members of a larger number of protein complexes and this justifies why they have enhanced expression levels.

However, this important structural property has been poorly investigated in nucleic acids. On the other hand investigation of structural determinants of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in gene expression are also in a primitive stage and there is a need to explore novel sequence and structural features of both DNA and RNA, which may explain both basic and regulatory mechanisms at various stages of expression. We have recently shown that the nucleotide accessibility in double-stranded DNA molecules strongly depends on sequence context and can be predicted using neighbor information. In this work, we investigate statistics, neighbor-dependence and predictability of nucleotide solvent accessibility for various types of RNA molecules (single-stranded, double-stranded, protein-unbound and protein-bound). It was found that average solvent accessibility of different RNA trinucleotides varies considerably. Interestingly, important translational signals (initiatory AUG codon, Shine-Dalgharno site) were characterized by high solvent accessibility that could be important for its selection in evolution. We also analyzed a relationship between nucleotide accessibility and synonymous codon usage bias in some genomes and find that the two properties are directly related. We believe that the analysis and prediction of nucleotide solvent accessibility opens new avenues to explore more biologically meaningful relationship between RNA structure and function.

We observed that both non-hub and hub proteins present in protein complexes, are characterized by high structural disorderness. There exists no significant difference in average evolutionary rate of complex-forming hub and non-hub proteins while we have found a significant difference in the average evolutionary rate between hub and non-hub proteins which are not present in protein complexes. We concluded that higher disorderness in complex forming non-hub proteins facilitates higher number of interactions with a large number of protein subunits. High interaction among protein subunits of complex forming non-hub proteins imposes a selective constraint on their evolutionary rate. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As with retrotransposons they can accumulate in number, but in this case by various processes of mitotic or meiotic drive, based on their own autonomous ways of using spindles, especially in the game-tophyte phase of the life cycle of flowering plants. This selfish property of drive ensures their survival and spread in natural populations, even against a gradient of harmful effects on the host plant phenotype. Bs are inhabitants of the nucleus and they are subject to control by 'genes' in the A chromosome (As) complement. This interaction with the As, together with the balance between drive and harmful effects makes a dynamic system in the life of a B chromosome, notwithstanding the fact that we are only now beginning to unravel the story in a few favoured species. In this review we concentrate mainly on recent developments in the Bs of rye and maize, two of the species currently receiving most attention. We focus on their population dynamics and on the molecular basis of their structural organisation and mechanisms of drive, as well as on their mode of origin and potential applications in plant biotechnology.

Taking advantage of publicly available gene expression data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a systematic analysis of the codon and amino acid usages in two different coding regions corresponding to the regular (helix and strand) as well as the irregular (coil) protein secondary structures, have been performed. Our analyses suggest that apart from tRNA abundance, mRNA folding stability is another major evolutionary force in shaping the codon and amino acid usage differences between the highly and lowly expressed genes in S. cerevisiae genome and surprisingly it depends on the coding regions corresponding to the secondary structures of the encoded proteins. This is obviously a new paradigm in understanding the codon usage in S. cerevisiae. Differential amino acid usage between highly and lowly expressed genes in the regions coding for the irregular protein secondary structure in S. cerevisiae is expounded by the stability of the mRNA folded structure. Irrespective of the protein secondary structural type, the highly expressed genes always tend to encode cheaper amino acids in order to reduce the overall biosynthetic cost of production of the corresponding protein. This study supports the hypothesis that the tRNA abundance is a consequence of and not a reason for the biased usage of amino acid between highly and lowly expressed genes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The activation of these genes is driven by promoter complexes, and RNA synthesis is performed by an enzyme mega-complex--the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. These two complexes are the fundamental components required to initiate gene expression and generate the primary transcripts that, after processing, yield mRNAs that pass to the cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs. But although this gene expression pathway has been studied intensively, aspects of RNA metabolism remain difficult to comprehend. In particular, it is unclear why >95\% of RNA polymerized by polymerase II remains in the nucleus, where it is recycled. To explain this apparent paradox, this review presents a detailed description of nuclear RNA (nRNA) metabolism in mammalian cells. We evaluate the number of active transcription units, discuss the distribution of polymerases on active genes, and assess the efficiency with which the products mature and pass to the cytoplasm. Differences between the behavior of mRNAs on this productive pathway and primary transcripts that never leave the nucleus lead us to propose that these represent distinct populations. We discuss possible roles for nonproductive RNAs and present a model to describe the metabolism of these RNAs in the nuclei of mammalian cells.

abstract ={The genetic code is redundant with most amino acids using multiple codons. In many organisms, codon usage is biased toward particular codons. Understanding the adaptive and nonadaptive forces driving the evolution of codon usage bias (CUB) has been an area of intense focus and debate in the fields of molecular and evolutionary biology. However, their relative importance in shaping genomic patterns of CUB remains unsolved. Using a nested model of protein translation and population genetics, we show that observed gene level variation of CUB in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be explained almost entirely by selection for efficient ribosomal usage, genetic drift, and biased mutation. The correlation between observed codon counts within individual genes and our model predictions is 0.96. Although a variety of factors shape patterns of CUB at the level of individual sites within genes, our results suggest that selection for efficient ribosome usage is a central force in shaping codon usage at the genomic scale. In addition, our model allows direct estimation of codon-specific mutation rates and elongation times and can be readily applied to any organism with high-throughput expression datasets. More generally, we have developed a natural framework for integrating models of molecular processes to population genetics models to quantitatively estimate parameters underlying fundamental biological processes, such a protein translation.},

To allow a comprehensive analysis of hotspot-associated DNA and chromatin characteristics, we developed a direct molecular approach for mapping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks that initiate recombination. Here we present the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in the mouse genome. Hotspot centres are mapped with approximately 200-nucleotide precision, which allows analysis of the fine structural details of the preferred recombination sites. We determine that hotspots share a centrally distributed consensus motif, possess a nucleotide skew that changes polarity at the centres of hotspots and have an intrinsic preference to be occupied by a nucleosome. Furthermore, we find that the vast majority of recombination initiation sites in mouse males are associated with testis-specific trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 that is distinct from histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation marks associated with transcription. The recombination map presented here has been derived from a homogeneous mouse population with a defined genetic background and therefore lends itself to extensive future experimental exploration. We note that the mapping technique developed here does not depend on the availability of genetic markers and hence can be easily adapted to other species with complex genomes. Our findings uncover several fundamental features of mammalian recombination hotspots and underline the power of the new recombination map for future studies of genetic recombination, genome stability and evolution.},

What determines where meiotic DSBs are created and whether a crossover or non-crossover will be formed at any particular DSB remains largely unclear. Nevertheless, several recent papers have revealed important insights into the factors that control the decision between crossover and non-crossover formation in meiosis, including DNA elements that determine the positioning of meiotic DSBs, and the generation and processing of recombination intermediates. In this review, we focus on the factors that influence DSB positioning, the proteins required for the formation of recombination intermediates and how the processing of these structures generates either a crossover or non-crossover in various organisms. A discussion of crossover interference, assurance and homeostasis, which influence crossing over on a chromosome-wide and genome-wide scale - in addition to current models for the generation of interference - is also included.

Through different molecular processes, specific histone post-translational modifications are induced at specific genomic sites, called hotspots, where initiation of meiotic recombination takes place. These sites are some transcription promoters in S. cerevisiae or binding sites for transcription factors in S. pombe, where chromatin modifiers are recruited. In mammals, the sites are DNA sequences recognized by the PRDM9 protein which has the ability both to bind DNA and to induce the trimethylation of the lysine 4 of histone H3. The properties of the chromatin at these sites, and potentially the binding of additional factors, allow the recruitment of proteins involved in the formation of DNA double strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination.},

However, most non-crossover (NCO) recombinants generated during S. cerevisiae meiosis do not arise via a DSBR pathway. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that DSBR is a minor pathway for recombinational repair of DSBs that occur in mitotically-proliferating cells and that the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) model appears to describe mitotic DSB repair more accurately. Fundamental dissimilarities between meiotic and mitotic recombination are not unexpected, since meiotic recombination serves a very different purpose (accurate chromosome segregation, which requires COs) than mitotic recombination (repair of DNA damage, which typically generates NCOs).},

This process increases offspring diversity through the random segregation of chromosomes and the exchange of genetic material between homologous parental chromosomes, known as meiotic crossover recombination. These exchanges require the establishment of unique and dynamic chromatin configurations that facilitate cohesion, homolog pairing, synapsis, double strand break formation and repair. The precise orchestration of these events is critical for gamete survival as demonstrated by the majority of human aneuploidies that can be traced to defects in the first meiotic division (Hassold T, Hall H, Hunt P: The origin of human aneuploidy: where we have been, where we are going.

We provide direct evidence that the vast majority of repair events are interhomolog NCOs, consistent with models in which frequent interhomolog interactions promote accurate chromosome pairing. NCOs peaked at the center of the hot spot but were also broadly distributed throughout. In some hybrid strains, localized zones within the hot spot were highly refractory to COs and showed elevated frequency of coconversion of adjacent polymorphisms in NCOs, raising the possibility of double-strand gap repair. Transmission distortion was observed in one hybrid, with NCOs providing a significant contribution. Thus, NCO recombination events play a substantial role in mammalian meiosis and genome evolution.

These studies indicate that the long-dominant, unifying model of recombination proposed by Szostak et al applies, with modification, only to a subset of recombination events. Instead, crossover formation and its control involve multiple pathways, with considerable variation among model organisms. These observations force us to 'branch out' in our thinking about meiotic recombination.

COs are not randomly distributed but are found at specific regions, or CO hotspots. Recent results have revealed the historical recombination rates and the distribution of hotspots across the human genome. Surprisingly, CO hotspots are highly dynamic, as shown by differences in activity between individuals, populations and closely related species. We propose a role for DNA methylation in preventing the formation of COs, a regulation that might explain, in part, the correlation between recombination rates and GC content in mammals.

How these events are differentiated and regulated remains to be determined. We have developed a strategy to detect, quantify, and map NCRs in parallel to CRs, at the Psmb9 melotic recombination hot spot, in male and female mouse germ lines. Our results report direct molecular evidence for distinct CR and NCR pathways of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in mouse meiosis based on three observations: both CRs and NCRs require Spo11, NCR products have shorter conversion tracts than CRs, and only CRs require the MutL homolog Mlh1. We show that both products are formed from middle to late pachytene of meiotic prophase and provide evidence for an Mlh1-independent CR pathway, where mismatch repair does not require Mih1.

Model parameters are estimated from available experimental data. The model is shown to have a single stable steady state for these estimated parameter values, and this steady state corresponds to the lysogenic state. When the CI degradation rate (gamma(cl)) is slightly increased from its normal value (gamma(cl) similar or equal to 0.0 min(-1)), two additional steady states appear ( through a saddle-node bifurcation) in addition to the lysogenic state. One of these new steady states is stable and corresponds to the lytic state. The other steady state is an ( unstable) saddle node. The coexistence these two globally stable steady states ( the lytic and lysogenic states) is maintained with further increases of gamma(cl) until gamma(cl) similar or equal to 0.35 min(-1), when the lysogenic steady state and the saddle node collide and vanish ( through a reverse saddle node bifurcation) leaving only the lytic state surviving. These results allow us to understand the high degree of stability of the lysogenic state because, normally, it is the only steady state. Further implications of these results for the stability of the phage lambda switch are discussed, as well as possible experimental tests of the model.

COMP and collagen (Col) IX (A1, A2 and A3) mutations, were determined. Patients who tested negative for pathological gene mutations but who were identified with the PSACH phenotype, were included. The phenotypes were characterized according to height deviation (cm) from normal, lower extremity mechanical axis deviation (MAD), cervical and thoracolumbar spine involvement, pelvic index, as well as hip, knee, ankle and hand involvement. We report an 81\% mutation detection rate for PSACH, of which COMP+Col9A3 mutations were more prevalent (61\%) than COMP mutations alone (30\%). Of our PSACH patients, 19\% tested negative for both COMP and Col9A3 mutations, and they presented with the greatest mean height deviations, but the least mean MADs. While all the PSACH mutations consistently produced the severe phenotype, the V426A mutation in Col9A3 produced the most severe. Mother-daughter and father-son phenotypic similarities were noted in the COMP+Col9A3 families. Col9A3 and gender play confounding roles in the phenotypic severity of PSACH. The presence of the PSACH phenotype in patients who tested negative for known mutations further confirms the genetic heterogeneity of this condition.

ECM1 inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy, matrix mineralization, and endochondral bone formation, and COMP overcomes the inhibition by ECM1.

Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein has been studied extensively because mutations in the gene cause two skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Pseudoachondroplasia is a disproportionate dwarfing condition associated with joint abnormalities, while multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is less severe. Both of these skeletal dysplasias have a characteristic chondrocyte pathology that consists of intracellular retention of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and other extracellular matrix proteins in an enlarged rough endoplasmic reticulum. This toxic intracellular retention of extracellular matrix proteins causes chondrocyte cell death thereby decreasing linear bone growth. Additionally, when cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and the other co-retained proteins are not exported to the extracellular matrix, the resulting matrix is abnormal and easily erodes with normal physical activity. Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein is also a marker for joint destruction associated osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, joint trauma, and intense activity. Serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein levels are higher in aggressive cases of arthritis and levels are used to predict future disease progression. Recent studies have identified molecular functions of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein that may contribute to its role in skeletal disease. These molecular functions include: binding other ECM proteins, catalyzing polymerization of type II collagen fibrils, and regulation of chondrocyte proliferation. Here, we review cartilage oligomeric matrix protein's role in skeletal disease and potential molecular mechanisms.},

The genes associated with different diseases are unrelated and harbor a trinucleotide repeat in different functional regions; therefore, it is striking that many of these diseases have similar correlations between their genotype, namely the number of inherited repeats and age of onset and progression phenotype. These correlations remain unexplained despite more than a decade of research. Although mechanisms have been proposed for several trinucleotide diseases, none of the proposals, being disease-specific, can account for the commonalities among these diseases. Here, we propose a universal mechanism in which length-dependent somatic repeat expansion occurs during the patient's lifetime toward a pathological threshold. Our mechanism uniformly explains for the first time to our knowledge the genotype phenotype correlations common to trinucleotide disease and is well-supported by both experimental and clinical data. In addition, mathematical analysis of the mechanism provides simple explanations to a wide range of phenomena such as the exponential decrease of the age-of-onset curve, similar onset but faster progression in patients with Huntington disease with homozygous versus heterozygous mutation, and correlation of age of onset with length of the short allele but not with the long allele in Friedreich ataxia. If our proposed universal mechanism proves to be the core component of the actual mechanisms of specific trinucleotide diseases, it would open the search for a uniform treatment for all these diseases, possibly by delaying the somatic expansion process.

The mutation penetrance varies widely and depends on the CAG expansion length, the low pathological triplet range (36-41) showing a very low penetrance, possibly associated with late ages at onset. No research has so far yielded biomarkers for accurately predicting either age at onset or disease progression in at risk individuals. Specific markers able to follow-up mutation carrier subjects from the pre-symptomatic stages of life are crucial for testing experimental neuroprotective preventive therapies. Nevertheless, the factor accounting for the largest percentage of age at onset variation is the expanded repeat number within the gene. Over the years, this factor has helped in setting up models for genetically predicting age at onset. Once available for practical application in clinics, such models allowed phenotype-genotype correlations that were hitherto inconceivable. In this review, we discuss how these genetic models have been applied in clinical practice and comment on their potential value in searching for cerebral biomarkers of disease onset and severity and in designing trials of therapeutic drugs.

We also identified within this domain a missense mutation that produced MED Fairbank. In two families, one with mild PSACH and the second with a form of MED, we identified different substitutions for a residue in the carboxyl-terminal globular region of COMP. Both the clinical presentations of these two families and the identification of COMP-gene mutations provide evidence of phenotypic overlap between PSACH and MED.

Here, we identify a universally conserved profile of translation efficiency along mRNAs computed based on adaptation between coding sequences and the tRNA pool. In this profile, the first ~30-50 codons are, on average, translated with a low efficiency. Additionally, in eukaryotes, the last ~50 codons show the highest efficiency over the full coding sequence. The profile accurately predicts position-dependent ribosomal density along yeast genes. These data suggest that translation speed and, as a consequence, ribosomal density are encoded by coding sequences and the tRNA pool. We suggest that the slow ramp at the beginning of mRNAs serves as a late stage of translation initiation, forming an optimal and robust means to reduce ribosomal traffic jams, thus minimizing the cost of protein expression."

The prediction of metal ion-binding sites have success rates between 90\% and 97\% depending on the metal, with an overall standard deviation on the position of binding of 0.3-0.6 angstrom.

Additionally, the free energy of binding of Ca2+ and Zn2+ (i.e., the natural logarithm of the dissociation constant) and its dependence on ionic strength correlate reasonably well with the experimental data available in the literature, allowing one to discriminate between highand low-affinity binding sites. Importantly, the accuracy of the energy prediction presented here is sufficient to efficiently discriminate between Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ binding.},

Using a model of protein translation based on tRNA competition and intra-ribosomal kinetics, we show that this assumption can be violated when tRNA abundances are positively correlated across the genetic code. Examining the distribution of tRNA abundances across 73 bacterial genomes from 20 different genera, we find a consistent positive correlation between tRNA abundances across the genetic code. This work challenges one of the fundamental assumptions made in over 30 years of research on CUB that codons with higher tRNA abundances have lower missense error rates and that missense errors are the primary selective force responsible for CUB.

We have developed a novel method of studying the melting of RNAs with temperature by computationally sampling the distribution of the RNA structures at various temperatures using the RNA folding software Vienna. In this study, we compared the thermosensing property of 100 randomly selected mRNAs and three well known thermometers rpoH, ibpA and agsA sequences from E. coli. We also compared the rpoH sequences from 81 mesophilic proteobacteria. Although both rpoH and ibpA show a higher rate of melting at their RBS compared with the mean of non-thermometers, contrary to our expectations these higher rates are not significant. Surprisingly, we also do not find any significant differences between rpoH thermometers from other gamma-proteobacteria and E. coli non-thermometers.

The FabR (fatty acid biosynthesis repressor) transcriptional repressor controls the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane by regulating the expression of the fabB (beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I) and fabA (beta-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP dehydratase/isomerase) genes. FabR binding to a DNA palindrome located within the promoters of the fabB and fabA genes required the presence of an unsaturated acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) or acyl-CoA and was antagonized by saturated acyl-ACP or acyl-CoA. The FabR-dependent repression of fabB and fabA by exogenous unsaturated fatty acids confirmed the role for FabR in responding to the acyl-CoA pool composition, and the perturbation of the unsaturated: saturated acyl-ACP ratio using a specific inhibitor of lipid A formation verified FabR-dependent regulation of fabB by the acyl-ACP composition in vivo. Thus, FabR plays a key role in controlling the membrane biophysical properties by regulating gene expression in response to the composition of the long-chain acyl-thioester pool. This mechanism ensures that a balanced composition of fatty acids is available for incorporation into the membrane via the PlsB/PlsC acyltransferases.

Transcriptional repression was shown to be the major control mechanism of the biosynthetic genes, leaving only limited room for additional transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. The art genes, encoding the specific arginine uptake system, are subject to ArgR-mediated repression, with strong repression of artJ, encoding the periplasmic binding protein of the system. The hisJQMP genes of the histidine transporter (part of the lysine-arginine-ornithine uptake system) were discovered to be a part of the arginine regulon. Analysis of their control region with reporter gene fusions and electrophoretic mobility shift in the presence of pure ArgR repressor showed the involvement in repression of the ArgR protein and an ARG box 120 bp upstream of hisJ. No repression of the genes of the third uptake system, arginine-ornithine, was observed. Finally, comparison of the time course of arginine repression of gene transcription with the evolution of the specific activities of the cognate enzymes showed that while full genetic repression was achieved 2 min after arginine addition, enzyme concentrations were diluted at the rate of cell division. This emphasizes the importance of feedback inhibition of the first enzymic step in the pathway in controlling the metabolic flow through biosynthesis in the period following the onset of repression.},

	  Results: We conceived an idea of competitive PCR between genomic DNA and cDNA. Since the former contains every gene exactly at the same copy number, it can serve as an ideal normalization standard for the latter to obtain stoichiometric composition data of the transcriptome. This data can then be easily converted to absolute quantification data provided with an appropriate calibration. To implement this idea, we improved adaptor-tagged competitive PCR, originally developed for relative quantification of the 3'-end restriction fragment of each cDNA, such that it can be applied to any restriction fragment. We demonstrated that this "generalized" adaptor-tagged competitive PCR (GATC-PCR) can be performed between genomic DNA and cDNA to accurately measure absolute expression level of each mRNA in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, we constructed a large-scale GATC-PCR system to measure absolute expression levels of 5,038 genes to show that the yeast contains more than 30,000 copies of mRNA molecules per cell.
	  Conclusion: We developed a GATC-PCR method to accurately measure absolute expression levels of mRNAs by means of competitive amplification of genomic and cDNA copies of each gene. A large-scale application of GATC-PCR to the budding yeast transcriptome revealed that it is twice or more as large as previously estimated. This method is flexibly applicable to both targeted and genome-wide analyses of absolute expression levels of mRNAs.

However, several drawbacks to this form of data have been noted, including the inability to relate ratios to absolute expression levels or to compare experimental conditions not measured with the same control. In this study we demonstrate a method for overcoming these obstacles. First, instead of cohybridizing labeled experimental and control samples, we hybridize each sample against labeled oligos complementary to every microarray feature. Ratios between sample intensities and intensities of the oligo reference measure sample RNA levels on a scale that relates to their absolute abundance, instead of to the variable and unknown abundances of a cDNA reference. We demonstrate that results from this type of hybridization are accurate and retain absolute abundance information far better than conventional microarray ratios. Next, to ensure the accurate measurement of sample and oligo reference intensities, which may differ by several orders of magnitude, we use a linear regression algorithm, implemented in a freely available PERIL script, to combine the linear ranges of multiple scans taken at different scanner sensitivity settings onto an extended linear scale. We discuss future applications of our method to measure RNA expression on the absolute scale of number of transcripts per cell from any organism for which oligo-based spotted-glass microarrays are available.

CAI is a geometric mean of the relative usage of codons in a gene, and is calculated using the codon usage table trained with a set of highly expressed genes. In contrast, rCAI is computed by subtracting the background codon usage trained with two noncoding frames of highly expressed genes from the codon usage in the coding frame. rCAI has higher signal-to-noise ratio than CAI, considering that noncoding frames would not show codon bias. Translation efficiency and protein abundance correlates comparably or better with rCAI than CAI or other measures such as 'effective number of codons' and 'SCUMBLE offsets'. Within overlapping coding regions, one of the two coding frames dominates in codon usage bias according to rCAI. Presumably, rCAI could substitute CAI in diverse applications.},

Taking advantage of publicly available gene expression data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a systematic analysis of the codon and amino acid usages in two different coding regions corresponding to the regular (helix and strand) as well as the irregular (coil) protein secondary structures, have been performed. Our analyses suggest that apart from tRNA abundance, mRNA folding stability is another major evolutionary force in shaping the codon and amino acid usage differences between the highly and lowly expressed genes in S. cerevisiae genome and surprisingly it depends on the coding regions corresponding to the secondary structures of the encoded proteins. This is obviously a new paradigm in understanding the codon usage in S. cerevisiae. Differential amino acid usage between highly and lowly expressed genes in the regions coding for the irregular protein secondary structure in S. cerevisiae is expounded by the stability of the mRNA folded structure. Irrespective of the protein secondary structural type, the highly expressed genes always tend to encode cheaper amino acids in order to reduce the overall biosynthetic cost of production of the corresponding protein. This study supports the hypothesis that the tRNA abundance is a consequence of and not a reason for the biased usage of amino acid between highly and lowly expressed genes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the conflict between ensuring splicing efficiency and preserving the coding capacity for an optimal protein during evolution has not been specifically analyzed. In fact, studies on genomic variability in fields as diverse as clinical genetics and molecular evolution mainly focus on the effect of mutations on protein function. Synonymous variations, in particular, are assumed to be functionally neutral both in clinical diagnosis and when measuring evolutionary distances between species. Using the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exon 12 splicing as a model, we have established that about one quarter of synonymous variations result in exon skipping and, hence, in an inactive CFTR protein. Furthermore, comparative splicing evaluation of mammalian sequence divergences showed that artificial combinations of CFTR exon 12 synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions are incompatible with normal RNA processing. In particular, the combination of the mouse synonymous with the human missense variations causes exon skipping. It follows that there are two sequential levels at which evolutionary selection of genomic variants take place: splicing control and protein function optimization.

	abstract    = {Background: The genome of Paramecium tetraurelia, a unicellular model that belongs to the ciliate phylum, has been shaped by at least 3 successive whole genome duplications (WGD). These dramatic events, which have also been documented in plants, animals and fungi, are resolved over evolutionary time by the loss of one duplicate for the majority of genes. Thanks to a low rate of large scale genome rearrangement in Paramecium, an unprecedented large number of gene duplicates of different ages have been identified, making this organism an outstanding model to investigate the evolutionary consequences of polyploidization. The most recent WGD, with 51\% of pre-duplication genes still in 2 copies, provides a snapshot of a phase of rapid gene loss that is not accessible in more ancient polyploids such as yeast. Results: We designed a custom oligonucleotide microarray platform for P. tetraurelia genome-wide expression profiling and used the platform to measure gene expression during 1) the sexual cycle of autogamy, 2) growth of new cilia in response to deciliation and 3) biogenesis of secretory granules after massive exocytosis. Genes that are differentially expressed during these time course experiments have expression patterns consistent with a very low rate of subfunctionalization (partition of ancestral functions between duplicated genes) in particular since the most recent polyploidization event.
	  Conclusions: A public transcriptome resource is now available for Paramecium tetraurelia. The resource has been integrated into the ParameciumDB model organism database, providing searchable access to the data. The microarray platform, freely available through NimbleGen Systems, provides a robust, cost-effective approach for genome-wide expression profiling in P. tetraurelia. The expression data support previous studies showing that at short evolutionary times after a whole genome duplication, gene dosage balance constraints and not functional change are the major determinants of gene retention.

	abstract    = {The duplication of entire genomes has long been recognized as having great potential for evolutionary novelties, but the mechanisms underlying their resolution through gene loss are poorly understood. Here we show that in the unicellular eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia, a ciliate, most of the nearly 40,000 genes arose through at least three successive whole-genome duplications. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the most recent duplication coincides with an explosion of speciation events that gave rise to the P. aurelia complex of 15 sibling species. We observed that gene loss occurs over a long timescale, not as an initial massive event. Genes from the same metabolic pathway or protein complex have common patterns of gene loss, and highly expressed genes are over-retained after all duplications. The conclusion of this analysis is that many genes are maintained after whole-genome duplication not because of functional innovation but because of gene dosage constraints.

The Coding Sequence and Structure (CSandS) database developed in this work provides a detailed mapping between over 4000 solved protein structures and their mRNA. CSandS facilitates a comprehensive analysis of codon usage over many organisms. In assigning translation speed, we find that relative codon usage is less informative than tRNA concentration. For all speed measures, no evidence was found that domain boundaries are enriched with slow codons. In fact, genes seemingly avoid slow codons around structurally defined domain boundaries. Translation speed, however, does decrease at the transition into secondary structure. Codons are identified that have structural preferences significantly different from the amino acid they encode. However, each organism has its own set of 'significant codons'. Our results support the premise that codons encode more information than merely amino acids and give insight into the role of translation in protein folding.

However, empirical evidence from genome duplication events suggests that gene duplicates are preserved in genomes far more commonly and for periods far in excess of the expectations under this model, and whereas some gene duplicates clearly evolve new functions, there is little evidence that this is the most common mechanism of duplicate-gene preservation. An alternative hypothesis is that gene duplicates are frequently preserved by subfunctionalization, whereby both members of a pair experience degenerative mutations that reduce their joint levels and patterns of activity to that of the single ancestral gene. We consider the ways in which thf probability of duplicate-gene preservation by such complementary mutations is modified by aspects of gene structure, degree of linkage, mutation rates and effects, and population size. Even if most mutations cause complete loss-of-subfunction, the probability of duplicate-gene preservation can be appreciable if the long-term effective population size is on the order of 10(5) or smaller, especially if ther are more than two, independently mutable subfunctions per locus. Even a moderate incidence of partial loss-of-function mutations greatly elevates the probability of preservation, nle model proposed herein leads to quantitative predictions that are consistent with observations on die frequency of long-term duplicate gene preservation and with observations that indicate tl-lat a common fate of the members of duplicate-gene pairs is the partitioning of tissue-specific patterns of expression of die ancestral gene.

A number of recent studies have used green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging and fluorescence microscopy to probe the movement and distribution of proteins in the bacterial cytoplasm. However, the dynamic behavior of indigenous proteins must be controlled by a complex mixture of specific interactions, combined with the basic physical constraints imposed by the viscosity and macromolecular crowding of the cytoplasm. These factors are difficult to unravel in studies with indigenous proteins. To what extent the addition of a GFP tag might affect the movement of a protein through the cytoplasm has also remained unknown. To resolve these problems, we have carried out a systematic study of the size dependence of protein diffusion coefficients in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm, using engineered GFP multimers (from 2 to 6 covalently linked GFP molecules). Diffusion coefficients were measured using confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). At least up to 110 kDa (four linked GFP molecules), the diffusion coefficient varies with size roughly as would be predicted from the Einstein-Stokes equation for a classical (Newtonian) fluid. Thus, protein diffusion coefficients are predictable over this range. GFP tagging of proteins has little impact on the diffusion coefficient over this size range and therefore need not significantly perturb protein movement. Two indigenous E. coli proteins were used to show that their specific interactions within the cell are the main controllers of the diffusion rate.

Knowledge of the rates at which proteins and other cell components can diffuse is crucial for the understanding of a cell as a physical system. There have been numerous measurements of diffusion coefficients in eukaryotic cells by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and related techniques. Much less information is available about diffusion coefficients in prokaryotic cells, which differ from eukaryotic cells in a number of significant respects. We have used FRAP to observe the diffusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in cells of Escherichia coli elongated by growth in the presence of cephalexin. GFP was expressed in the cytoplasm, exported into the periplasm using the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system, or fused to an integral plasma membrane protein (TatA). We show that TatA-GFP diffuses in the plasma membrane with a diffusion coefficient comparable to that of a typical eukaryotic membrane protein. A previous report showed a very low rate of protein diffusion in the E. coli periplasm. However, we measured a GFP diffusion coefficient only slightly smaller in the periplasm than that in the cytoplasm, showing that both cell compartments are relatively fluid environments.

	abstract    = {Background: Since thermodynamic stability is a global property of proteins that has to be conserved during evolution, the selective pressure at a given site of a protein sequence depends on the amino acids present at other sites. However, models of molecular evolution that aim at reconstructing the evolutionary history of macromolecules become computationally intractable if such correlations between sites are explicitly taken into account.
	  Results: We introduce an evolutionary model with sites evolving independently under a global constraint on the conservation of structural stability. This model consists of a selection process, which depends on two hydrophobicity parameters that can be computed from protein sequences without any fit, and a mutation process for which we consider various models. It reproduces quantitatively the results of Structurally Constrained Neutral (SCN) simulations of protein evolution in which the stability of the native state is explicitly computed and conserved. We then compare the predicted site-specific amino acid distributions with those sampled from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The parameters of the mutation model, whose number varies between zero and five, are fitted from the data. The mean correlation coefficient between predicted and observed site-specific amino acid distributions is larger than < r > = 0.70 for a mutation model with no free parameters and no genetic code. In contrast, considering only the mutation process with no selection yields a mean correlation coefficient of < r > = 0.56 with three fitted parameters. The mutation model that best fits the data takes into account increased mutation rate at CpG dinucleotides, yielding < r > = 0.90 with five parameters. Conclusion: The effective selection process that we propose reproduces well amino acid distributions as observed in the protein sequences in the PDB. Its simplicity makes it very promising for likelihood calculations in phylogenetic studies. Interestingly, in this approach the mutation process influences the effective selection process, i. e. selection and mutation must be entangled in order to obtain effectively independent sites. This interdependence between mutation and selection reflects the deep influence that mutation has on the evolutionary process: The bias in the mutation influences the thermodynamic properties of the evolving proteins, in agreement with comparative studies of bacterial proteomes, and it also influences the rate of accepted mutations.

Moreover, these numbers exclude the many diverse lineages of non-respiring eukaryotes that lack a mitochondrial genome yet still contain a mitochondrion, albeit one often highly derived in ultrastructure and metabolic function, such as the hydrogenosome. Diversity in tRNA gene content primarily reflects differential usage of imported tRNAs of nuclear origin. In the case of protein genes, most of this diversity reflects differential degrees of functional gene transfer to the nucleus, with more minor contributions resulting from gene loss from the cell as a consequence of either substitution via a functional nuclear homolog or the cell's dispensation of the function of the gene product. The tempo and pattern of mitochondrial gene loss is highly episodic, both across the broad sweep of eukaryotes and within such well-studied groups as angiosperms. All animals, some plants, and certain other groups of eukaryotes are mired in profound stases in mitochondrial gene content, whereas other lineages have experienced relatively frequent gene loss. Loss and transfer to the nucleus of ribosomal protein and succinate dehydrogenase genes has been especially frequent, sporadic, and episodic during angiosperm evolution. Potential mechanisms for activation of transferred genes have been inferred, and intermediate stages in the process have been identified by comparative studies. Several hypotheses have been proposed for why mitochondrial genes are transferred to the nucleus, why mitochondria retain genomes, and why functional gene transfer is almost exclusively unidirectional.

The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii fits this description well. Sexual reproduction occurs in the cat intestine, from which highly stable oocysts are excreted in faeces. Grazing animals, including rodents, can then ingest these oocysts. The parasite has evolved the capacity to abolish the innate fear that rodents have of the odours of cats, and to convert that fear into an attraction. This presumably increases the likelihood of the rodent being predated, thereby completing the parasite's life cycle. The behavioural syndrome produced by T gondii does not have any precedent in neuroscience research. This is not a case where the normal functioning of fear system have been altered. This is not even the case of the altering of fear towards predator odours, while leaving other kinds of fear intact. This is an unprecedented example of one component of the fear being eliminated (and replaced by a novel attraction), while appearing to leave other domains unchanged. An understanding of the neurobiological effects of T gondii is beginning to emerge. One possibility is T gondii's preferential localisation to, and effects within the amygdala; this is particularly intriguing, given the role of this brain structure in the normal fear response. Obviously, far more must be understood, and the unique behavioural effects of T gondii put very demanding constraints on any hypothesis we formulate to explain proximate neurobiological mechanisms.

Methods - A narrative review of the literature from the main medical databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO), Google Scholar and Google using combinations of applicable terms. Results - T. gondii affects the brain in both the acute and the latent stages of infection causing apparent brain pathologies in infected rodents and both immuno-compromised and immuno-competent humans. In immuno-competent individuals, behavioural disorders are primarily related to the latent stages of the illness. Behavioural/mental disorders that include schizophrenia, mood disorders, personality changes and cognitive impairments may be related to infection with T gondii. Evidence for a behavioural effect of T gondii comes from observational reports in animal models and controlled behavioural analysis in humans. Indirect clues of infection also come from raised seroprevalence or serotitres of antitoxoplasma antibodies among those with mental disorders. The pathophysiologic mechanism through which T gondii may exert its effect is not clear, but direct impact on the brain and changes in neuroimmunomodulation, neurotransmission and some gene-environment interactions are postulated. Conclusion - There is evidence supporting a potential role of T gondii infection in the onset of some behavioural disorders. Confirmation of such a role would prove a significant breakthrough in the search for the aetiology, treatment and prevention of behavioural disorders, such as schizophrenia. However, the associations remain preliminary.

Using a Y-shaped maze design, we demonstrated that T. gondii-associated behavioural changes, apparently aimed to increase predation rate, do appear to be specific to that of the feline definitive host - there were significant and consistent differences between the (untreated) infected and uninfected rats groups where T. gondii-infected rats tended to choose the definitive host feline-predator-associated maze arm and nest-box significantly more often than a maze arm or nest-box treated with non-definitive host predator (mink) odour. Drug treatment of infected rats prevented any such host-specificity from being displayed. We discuss Our results in terms of their potential implications both for T. gondii epidemiology and the evolution of parasite-altered behaviour.

However, for many diseases, immunity wanes over time and is subsequently enhanced ( boosted) by asymptomatic encounters with the infection. The study of this type of epidemiological process requires a model formulation that can capture both the within-host dynamics of the pathogen and immune system as well as the associated population-level transmission dynamics. Here, we parametrize such a model for measles and show how vaccination can have a range of unexpected consequences as it reduces the natural boosting of immunity as well as reducing the number of naive susceptibles. In particular, we show that moderate waning times (40-80 years) and high levels of vaccination ( greater than 70\%) can induce large-scale oscillations with substantial numbers of symptomatic cases being generated at the peak. In addition, we predict that, after a long disease-free period, the introduction of infection will lead to far larger epidemics than that predicted by standard models. These results have clear implications for the long-term success of any vaccination campaign and highlight the need for a sound understanding of the immunological mechanisms of immunity and vaccination.},

In-host models can provide quantitative predictions of immune status and can thus offer valuable insights into the factors that influence transmission between individuals and the effectiveness of vaccination protocols with respect to individual immunity. Here we develop an in-host model of measles infection. The model explicitly considers the effects of immune system memory and C138 T-cells, which are key to measles clearance. The model is used to determine the effects of waning immunity through vaccination and infection, the effects of booster exposures or vaccines on the level of immunity, and the immune system characteristics that result in measles transmission (R-0 > 1) even if an individual has no apparent clinical symptoms. We find that the level of immune system CD8 T-cells at the time of exposure to measles determines whether an individual will experience a measles infection or simply a boost in immunity. We also find that the infected cell dynamics are a good indicator of measles transmission and the degree of symptoms that will be experienced. Our results indicate that the degree of immunity in adults is independent of the source of exposure in early childhood, be it vaccine or natural infection.

This paper explores the effects of incorporating genetic drift into models of fixation probability in populations with periodic bottlenecks. To model the inherent stochasticity during the growth phase in these populations, we assume a Poisson distribution of offspring. An analytical solution is developed to calculate the fixation probability and a computer simulation is used to verify the results. We find that the fixation rate of a favourable mutant is significantly lower when genetic drift is considered; fixation probability is reduced by over 25\% for realistic experimental protocols. Our method is valid for both weak and strong selection; since very large selection coefficients have been reported in the experimental literature, this is an important improvement over previous results.

Even beneficial mutations may, however, be lost from a population since mutant individuals may, by chance, fail to reproduce. In this paper, we calculate the probability of fixation of beneficial mutations that occur in populations of changing size. We examine a number of demographic models, including a population whose size changes once, a population experiencing exponential growth or decline, one that is experiencing logistic growth or decline, and a population that fluctuates in size. The results are based on a branching process model but are shown to be approximate solutions to the diffusion equation describing changes in the probability of fixation over time. Using the diffusion equation, the probability of fixation of deleterious alleles can also be determined for populations that are changing in size. The results developed in this paper can be used to estimate the fixation flux, defined as the rate at which beneficial alleles fix within a population. The fixation flux measures the rate of adaptive evolution of a population and, as we shall see, depends strongly on changes that occur in population size.

Here we present modified spectral count index (mSCI) for protein abundance estimation, which was defined as the number of observed peptides divided by protein relative identification possibility (RIPpro). RIPpro was derived from 6788 mRNA and protein expression data (collected from human liver samples) and related to proteins' three physical and chemical properties (MW/p//Hp). For 46 proteins in mouse neuro2a cells, mSCI shows a linear relationship with the actual protein concentration, similar or better than PAI abundance. Also, multiple linear regressions were performed to quantitative assess several factors' impact on the mRNA/protein abundance correlation. Our results shown that the primary factor affecting protein levels was mRNA abundance (32-37\%), followed by variability in protein measurement, MW and protein turnover (7-12\%,7-9\% and 2-3\%, respectively). Interestingly, we found that the concordance between mRNA transcripts and protein expression was not consistent among all protein functional categories This correlation was lower for signaling proteins as compared to metabolism genes. It was determined that RIPpro was the primary factor affecting signaling protein abundance (23\% on average), followed by mRNA abundance (17\%). In contrast, only 5\% (on average) of the variability of metabolic protein abundance was explained by RIPpro, much lower than mRNA abundance (40\%) These results provide the impetus for further investigation of the biological significance of mechanisms regulating the mRNA/protein abundance correlation and provide additional insight into the relative importance of the technological parameter (RIPpro) in mRNA/protein correlation research.},

Here, I use multilocus data to show that natural selection on both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations plays an important role in shaping levels of synonymous polymorphism in European aspen (Populus tremula). Previous studies have documented a preferential fixation of synonymous mutations encoding preferred codons in P. tremula. The results presented here show that this has resulted in an increase in codon bias in P. tremula, consistent with stronger selection acting on synonymous codon usage. In addition, positive selection on nonsynonymous mutations appears to be common in P. tremula, with approximately 30\% of all mutations having been fixed by positive selection. In addition, the recurrent fixation of beneficial mutations also reduces standing levels of polymorphism as evidenced by a significantly negative relationship between the rate of protein evolution synonymous site diversity and silent site diversity. Finally, I use approximate Bayesian methods to estimate the strength of selection acting on beneficial substitutions. These calculations show that recurrent hitchhiking reduces polymorphism by, on average, 30\%. The product of strength of selection acting on beneficial mutations and the rate by which these occur across the genome (2N(e)lambda s) equals 1.54x10 (- 7), which is in line with estimates from Drosophila where recurrent hitchhiking has also been shown to have significant effects on standing levels of polymorphism.

In this article, we present a novel network-based framework for reconstructing the evolutionary history of protein complexes. Our analysis is based on generalizing evolutionary measures for single proteins to the level of whole subnetworks, comprehensively considering a broad set of computationally derived complexes and accounting for both sequence and interaction changes. Specifically, we compute sets of orthologous complexes across species, and use these to derive evolutionary rate and age measures for protein complexes. We observe significant correlations between the evolutionary properties of a complex and those of its member proteins, suggesting that protein complexes form early in evolution and evolve as coherent units. Additionally, our approach enables us to directly quantify the extent to which gene duplication has played a role in the evolution of complexes. We find that about one quarter of the sets of orthologous complexes have originated from evolutionary cores of homodimers that underwent duplication and divergence, testifying to the important role of gene duplication in protein complex evolution.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the relationship between codon usage bias and protein structure in the genomes of four model organisms, Escherichia coli, yeast, fly, and mouse. Using both the Mantel-Haenszel procedure, which applies to categorical data, and a newly developed association test for continuous variables, we find that translationally optimal codons associate with buried residues and also with residues at sites where mutations lead to large changes in free energy (delta delta G). In each species, only a subset of all amino acids show this signal, but most amino acids show the signal in at least one species. By repeating the analysis on a reduced data set that excludes interdomain linkers, we show that our results are not caused by an association of rare codons with solvent-accessible linker regions. Finally, we find that our results depend weakly on expression level; the association between optimal codons and buried sites exists at all expression levels, but increases in strength as expression level increases.

We found the nsSNPs (and d(N)) and indels increased in protein boundary regions, and this pattern is inversely correlated with the distribution of protein domain density. Additionally, synonymous substitutions (and d(S)) are reduced in 51 and 31 regions, indicating more variable protein boundaries, compared with central interior. All evidence suggests that the inner part of coding sequences (CDSs) is comparatively conserved, whereas the 5' and 3' regions, with higher evolution rates, are more variable. We assumed that due to greater frequencies of nsSNPs and indels in adaptive regions of CDSs it could be easier to ultimately alter, gain, or lose amino acids, thus becoming the front line of protein evolution.

This is functionally important(1,2), as in allostery(3-5), and structurally crucial because mis- assembly of homomers is implicated in disease(6,7). Homomers are widespread, with 50 - 70\% of proteins with a known quaternary state assembling into such structures(8,9). Despite their prevalence, their role in the evolution of cellular machinery(10,11) and the potential for their use in the design of new molecular machines(12,13), little is known about the mechanisms that drive formation of homomers at the level of evolution and assembly in the cell(9,14). Here we present an analysis of over 5,000 unique atomic structures and show that the quaternary structure of homomers is conserved in over 70\% of protein pairs sharing as little as 30\% sequence identity. Where quaternary structure is not conserved among the members of a protein family, a detailed investigation revealed well- defined evolutionary pathways by which proteins transit between different quaternary structure types. Furthermore, we show by perturbing subunit interfaces within complexes and by mass spectrometry analysis(15), that the ( dis) assembly pathway mimics the evolutionary pathway. These data represent a molecular analogy to Haeckel's evolutionary paradigm of embryonic development, where an intermediate in the assembly of a complex represents a form that appeared in its own evolutionary history. Our model of self- assembly allows reliable prediction of evolution and assembly of a complex solely from its crystal structure.

In this review, we focus on known molecular mechanisms that increase genetic complexity at the molecular and functional levels, and discuss features that have likely contributed to organismal complexity.

Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes can then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma-dimensional hypercube with adsorbing boundaries determined, in each dimension, by loss of a protein's stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences. Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size, and thermodynamic response of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately six mutations per essential part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and one to two mutations per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Several RNA viruses function close to the evolutionary speed limit, whereas error correction mechanisms used by DNA viruses and nonmutant strains of bacteria featuring various genome lengths and mutation rates have brought these organisms universally approximate to 1,000-fold below the natural speed limit.

It is well known that molecular chaperones and elaborate quality control mechanisms exist in the cell to counteract aggregation. However, an increasing number of reports during the past few years indicate that proteins have also evolved structural and sequence-based strategies to prevent aggregation. This review describes these strategies and the selection pressures that exist on protein sequences to combat their uncontrolled aggregation. We will describe the different types of mechanism evolved by proteins that adopt different conformational states including normally folded proteins, intrinsically disordered polypeptide chains, elastomeric systems and multimodular proteins.

	  Results: We studied protein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, complexes of known three-dimensional structure in the Protein Data Bank and clusters of pairwise protein interactions in the networks of several organisms. We found that duplication of homomeric interactions, a large class of protein interactions, frequently results in the formation of complexes of paralogous proteins. This route is a common mechanism for the evolution of complexes and clusters of protein interactions. Our conclusions are further confirmed by theoretical modelling of network evolution. We propose reasons for why this is favourable in terms of structure and function of protein complexes. Conclusion: Our study provides the first insight into the evolution of functional modularity in protein-protein interaction networks, and the origins of a large class of protein complexes.

In this paper, I study associations between codon usage, gene expression, and molecular evolution at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in the long-lived, woody perennial plant Populus tremula (Salicaceae). Using expression data for 558 genes derived from expressed sequence tags (EST) libraries from 19 different tissues and developmental stages, I study how gene expression levels within single tissues as well as across tissues affect codon usage and rates sequence evolution at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. I show that gene expression have direct effects on both codon usage and the level of selective constraint of proteins in P. tremula, although in different ways. Codon usage genes is primarily determined by how highly expressed a genes is, whereas rates of sequence evolution are primarily determined by how widely expressed genes are. In addition to the effects of gene expression, protein length appear to be an important factor influencing virtually all aspects of molecular evolution in P. tremula.},

In the diverse land plants Marchantia polymorpha (liverwort) and Oryza sativa (rice), the mitochondrial-encoded L2 ribosomal protein is about 500 amino acids long owing to a centrally located expansion containing the beta 3-beta 4 strand region. We have determined that, in wheat, the functional rp12 gene has been transferred to the nucleus and much of the plant-specific internal insert has been deleted. Its mRNA is only 1.2 kb, and two expressed copies in wheat encode proteins of 318 and 319 amino acids, so they are considerably shorter than the maize nuclear-located rp12 gene of 448 codons. Comparative sequence analysis of cereal mitochondrial L2 ribosomal proteins indicates that the mid region has undergone unexpectedly rapid evolution during the last 60 million years.},

In tandem with this accumulation of sequence data, worldwide structural genomics initiatives, advanced by the development of improved technologies in X-ray crystallography and NMR, are expanding our knowledge of structural families and increasing our fold libraries. Methods for detecting remote sequence similarities have also been made more sensitive and this means that we can map domains from these structural families onto genome sequences to understand how these families are distributed throughout the genomes and reveal how they might influence the functional repertoires and biological complexities of the organisms.
	  We have used robust protocols to assign sequences from completed genomes to domain structures in the CATH database, allowing up to 60\% of domain sequences in these genomes, depending on the organism, to be assigned to a domain family of known structure. Analysis of the distribution of these families throughout bacterial genomes identified more than 300 universal families, some of which had expanded significantly in proportion to genome size. These highly expanded families are primarily involved in metabolism and regulation and appear to make major contributions to the functional repertoire and complexity of bacterial organisms.
	  When comparisons are made across all kingdoms of life, we find a smaller set of universal domain families (approx. 140), of which families involved in protein biosynthesis are the largest conserved component. Analysis of the behaviour of other families reveals that some (e.g. those involved in metabolism, regulation) have remained highly innovative during evolution, making it harder to trace their evolutionary ancestry. Structural analyses of metabolic families provide some insights into the mechanisms of functional innovation, which include changes in domain partnerships and significant structural embellishments leading to modulation of active sites and protein interactions.

We investigate the emergence of protein complexes and physical interactions between proteins by duplication, and review other mechanisms. We dissect the dataset of protein complexes of known three-dimensional structure, and show that roughly 90\% of these complexes contain contacts between identical proteins within the same complex. Proteins that are shared across different complexes occur frequently, and they tend to be essential genes more often than members of a single protein complex. We also provide a perspective on the evolutionary mechanisms driving the growth of other modular cellular networks such as transcriptional regulatory and metabolic networks.

Here we investigated the interplay between chain length and stability constraints using a simple model of protein folding and a statistical study of the Protein Data Bank. We distinguish two types of stability of the native state: with respect to the unfolded state (unfolding stability) and with respect to misfolded configurations (misfolding stability). Several contributions to stability are evaluated and their correlations are disentangled through principal components analysis, with the following main results. (1) We show that longer proteins can fulfil more easily the requirements of unfolding and misfolding stability, because they have a higher number of native interactions per residue. Consistently, in longer proteins native interactions are weaker and they are less optimized with respect to non-native interactions. (2) Stability against misfolding is negatively correlated with the strength of native interactions, which is related to hydrophobicity. Hence there is a trade-off between unfolding and misfolding stability. This trade-off is influenced by protein length: less hydrophobic sequences are observed in very long proteins. (3) The number of disulfide bonds is positively correlated with the deficit of free energy stabilizing the native state. Chain length and the number of disulfide bonds per residue are negatively correlated in proteins with short chains and uncorrelated in proteins with long chains. (4) The number of salt bridges per residue and per native contact increases with chain length. We interpret these observations as an indication that the constraints imposed by unfolding stability are less demanding in long proteins and they are further reduced by the competing requirement for stability against misfolding. In particular, disulfide bonds appear to be positively selected in short proteins, whereas they evolve in an effectively neutral way in long proteins.

Using a combination of pair-wise and profile-based sequence comparisons at the levels of proteins and the DNA of the sequenced eukaryotic genomes, combined with phylogenetic analyses to establish orthology relationships, we were able to (1) trace the origin of six of the supernumerary subunits to the alpha-proteobacterial ancestor of the mitochondria, (2) detect previously unidentified homology relations between subunits from fungi and mammals, (3) detect previously unidentified subunits in the genomes of several species and (4) document several cases of gene duplications among supernumerary subunits in the eukaryotes. One of these, a duplication of N7BM (B17.2), is particularly interesting as it has been lost from genomes that have also lost Complex I proteins, making it a candidate for a Complex I interacting protein. A parsimonious reconstruction of eukaryotic Complex I evolution shows an initial increase in size that predates the separation of plants, fungi and metazoa, followed by a gradual adding and incidental losses of subunits in the various evolutionary lineages. This evolutionary scenario is in contrast to that for Complex I in the prokaryotes, for which the combination of several separate, and previously independently functioning modules into a single complex has been proposed.

Sequences of those eukaryotic cytoplasmic riboproteins that have orthologs in both Bacteria and Archaea. exclusively match the archacal block structure. The distinct blocks do not correlate consistently with any identifiable functional or structural feature including RNA and protein contacts. This phylodomain-specific block pattern also exists in a number of other proteins associated with protein synthesis, but not among enzymes of intermediary metabolism. While the universal blocks imply that modern Bacteria and Archaea (as defined by their translational machinery) clearly have had a common ancestor, the phylodomain-specific blocks imply that these two groups derive from single, phylodomain-specific types that came into existence at some point Iona after that common ancestor. The simplest explanation for this pattern would be a major evolutionary bottleneck, or other scenario that drastically limited the progenitors of modern prokaryotic diversity at a time considerably after the evolution of a fully functional translation apparatus. The vast range of habitats and metabolisms that prokaryotes occupy today would thus reflect divergent evolution after such a restricting event. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis places the origin of eukaryotes at about the same time and shows a closer relationship of the eukaryotic ribosome-associated proteins to crenarchaeal rather than euryarchaeal Counterparts.

A simple stochastic model based on multiplicative processes has been proposed to explain the sequence length distribution.

Fusion events gave rise to multimodular penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The acyl serine transferase penicillin-binding (PB) module possesses the three active-site defining motifs of the superfamily; it is linked to the carboxy end of a non-penicillin-binding (n-PB) module through a conserved fusion site; the two modules form a single polypeptide chain which folds on the exterior of the plasma membrane and is anchored by a transmembrane spanner; and the full-size PBPs cluster into two classes, A and B. In the class A PBPs, the n-PB modules are a continuum of diverging sequences; they possess a five-motif amino acid sequence signature, and conserved dicarboxylic amino acid residues are probably elements of the glycosyl transferase catalytic center. The PB modules fall into five subclasses: A1 and A2 in gram-negative bacteria and A3, A4 and A5 in gram-positive bacteria. The foil-size class A PBPs combine the required enzymatic activities for peptidoglycan assembly from lipid-transported disaccharide-peptide units and almost certainly prescribe different, PB-module specific traits in peptidoglycan cross-linking. In the class B PBPs, the PB and n-PB modules cluster in a concerted manner: A PB module of subclass B2 or B3 is linked to an n-PB module of subclass B2 or B3 gram-negative bacteria, and a PB module of subclass B1, B4, or B5 is linked to an n-PB module of subclass B1, B4, or B5 in gram-positive bacteria. Class B PBPs are involved in cell morphogenesis. The three motifs borne by the n-PB modules are probably sites for module-module interaction and the polypeptide stretches which extend between motifs 1 and 2 are sites for protein-protein interaction. The full-size class B PBPs are an assortment of orthologs and paralogs, which prescribe traits as complex as wall expansion and septum formation. PBPs of subclass B1 are unique to gram-positive bacteria. They are not essential brit they represent an important mechanism of resistance to penicillin among the enterococci and staphylococci. Natural evolution and PBPand beta-lactamase-mediated resistance show that the ability of the catalytic centers to adapt their. properties to new situations is limitless. Studies of the reaction pathways by rising the methods of quantum chemistry suggest that resistance to penicillin is a road of no return.

	by sequencing the four loci CDC19, PHD1, FZF1 and SSU1 in 27 strains.
	Sequence analysis demonstrates a distinct population structure in
	S. cerevisiae, distinguishing strains collected from a Pennsylvanian
	oak forest and strains collected from vineyards, perhaps due to ecological
	rather than geographic factors. The low level of conflict observed
	between the gene trees estimated for each locus implies moderate
	recombination in nature. High polymorphism in the gene SSU1 provides
	evidence of diversifying selection on its protein product, a sulfite
	exporter, perhaps associated with the use of sulfur-based fungicides
	in vineyards. FZF1, encoding a transcription factor regulating the
	expression level of SSU1, displays even greater polymorphism. This,
	the first multilocus sequence study of population structure in natural

  abstract = {Background: Comparative genomics is the analysis and comparison of
	genomes from different species. This area of research is driven by
	the large number of sequenced genomes and heavily relies on efficient
	algorithms and software to perform pairwise and multiple genome comparisons.
	Results: Most of the software tools available are tailored for one
	specific task. In contrast, we have developed a novel system CoCoNUT
	(Computational Comparative geNomics Utility Toolkit) that allows
	solving several different tasks in a unified framework: (1) finding
	regions of high similarity among multiple genomic sequences and aligning
	them, (2) comparing two draft or multichromosomal genomes, (3) locating
	large segmental duplications in large genomic sequences, and (4)
	mapping cDNA/EST to genomic sequences. Conclusion: CoCoNUT is competitive
	with other software tools w.r.t. the quality of the results. The
	use of state of the art algorithms and data structures allows CoCoNUT
	to solve comparative genomics tasks more efficiently than previous
	tools. With the improved user interface (including an interactive
	visualization component), CoCoNUT provides a unified, versatile,
	and easy-to-use software tool for large scale studies in comparative

  abstract = {It is generally believed that the first organisms did not age, and
	that aging thus evolved at some point in the history of life. When
	and why this transition occurred is a fundamental question in evolutionary
	biology. Recent reports of aging in bacteria suggest that aging predates
	the emergence of eukaryotes and originated in simple unicellular
	organisms. Here we use simple models to study why such organisms
	would evolve aging. These models show that the differentiation between
	an aging parent and a rejuvenated offspring readily evolves as a
	strategy to cope with damage that accumulates due to vital activities.
	We use measurements of the age-specific performance of individual
	bacteria to test the assumptions of the model, and find evidence
	that they are fulfilled. The mechanism that leads to aging is expected
	to operate in a wide range of organisms, suggesting that aging evolved
	early and repeatedly in the history of life. Aging might thus be
	a more fundamental aspect of cellular organisms than assumed so far.

	Overlapping binding sites of RRF, EF-G, and the P-site {tRNA} suggest

  abstract = {Transfer RNA's role in decoding the genome is critical to the accuracy
	and efficiency of protein synthesis. Though modified nucleosides
	were identified in RNA 50 years ago, only recently has their importance
	to {tRNA}'s ability to decode cognate and wobble codons become apparent.
	RNA modifications are ubiquitous. To date, some 100 different posttranslational
	modifications have been identified. Modifications of {tRNA} are the
	most extensively investigated; however, many other RNAs have modified
	nucleosides. The modifications that occur at the first, or wobble
	position, of {tRNA}'s anticodon and those 3'-adjacent to the anticodon
	are of particular interest. The {tRNA}s most affected by individual
	and combinations of modifications respond to codons in mixed codon
	boxes where distinction of the third codon base is important for
	discriminating between the correct cognate or wobble codons and the
	incorrect near-cognate codons (e.g. AAA/G for lysine versus AAU/C
	asparagine). In contrast, other modifications expand wobble codon
	recognition, such as U.U base pairing, for {tRNA}s that respond to
	multiple codons of a 4-fold degenerate codon box (e.g. GUU/A/C/G
	for valine). Whether restricting codon recognition, expanding wobble,
	enabling translocation, or maintaining the messenger RNA, reading
	frame modifications appear to reduce anticodon loop dynamics to that
	accepted by the ribosome. Therefore, we suggest that anticodon stem
	and loop domain nucleoside modifications allow a limited number of
	{tRNA}s to accurately and efficiently decode the 61 amino acid codons
	by selectively restricting some anticodon-codon interactions and
	expanding others. },

	Populations are subject to repetitive Population size variations,
	fragmentation and secondary contacts at different spatiotemporal
	scales due to geological, climatic and ecological processes. In this
	paper, we examine how such dynamic landscapes can alter mutant fixation
	probability and time to fixation. We consider three stochastic landscape
	dynamics: (i) the population is subject to repetitive bottlenecks,
	(ii) to the repeated alternation of fragmentation and fusion of denies

	carrying capacity. We show by deriving a variance, a coalescent and
	a harmonic mean population effective size, and with simulations that
	these landscape dynamics generate repetitive founder effects which
	counteract selection, thereby decreasing the fixation probability
	of an advantageous mutant but accelerate fixation when it occurs.
	For models (ii) and (iii), we also highlight an antagonistic "refuge
	effect" which can strongly delay mutant fixation. The predominance
	of either founder effects or refuge effects determines the time to

  abstract = {Motivation: Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) is a powerful
	technology for measuring global gene expression, through rapid generation
	of large numbers of transcript tags. Beyond their intrinsic value
	in differential gene expression analysis, SAGE tag collections afford
	abundant information on the size and shape of the sample transcriptome
	and can accelerate novel gene discovery. These latter SAGE applications
	are facilitated by the enhanced method of Long SAGE. A characteristic
	of sequencing-based methods, such as SAGE and Long SAGE is the unavoidable
	occurrence of artifact sequences resulting from sequencing errors.
	By virtue of their low-random incidence, such tag errors have minimal
	impact on differential expression analysis. However, to fully exploit
	the value of large SAGE tag datasets, it is desirable to account
	for and correct tag artifacts. Results: We present estimates for
	occurrences of tag errors, and an efficient error correction algorithm.
	Error rate estimates are based on a stochastic model that includes
	the Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing error contributions.
	The correction algorithm, SAGEScreen, is a multi-step procedure that
	addresses ditag processing, estimation of empirical error rates from
	highly abundant tags, grouping of similar-sequence tags and statistical
	testing of observed counts. We apply SAGEScreen to Long SAGE libraries
	and compare error rates for several processing scenarios. Results
	with simulated tag collections indicate that SAGEScreen corrects
	78\% of recoverable tag errors and reduces the occurrences of singleton
	tags. },

  abstract = {Many technologies have been developed to help explain the function
	of genes discovered by systematic genome sequencing. At present,
	transcriptome and proteome studies dominate large-scale functional
	analysis strategies. Yet the metabolome, because it is 'downstream',
	should show greater effects of genetic or physiological changes and
	thus should be much closer to the phenotype of the organism. We earlier
	presented a functional analysis strategy that used metabolic fingerprinting
	to reveal the phenotype of silent mutations of yeast genes(1). However,
	this is difficult to scale up for high-throughput screening. Here
	we present an alternative that has the required throughput (2 min
	per sample). This 'metabolic footprinting' approach recognizes the
	significance of 'overflow metabolism' in appropriate media. Measuring
	intracellular metabolites is time-consuming and subject to technical
	difficulties caused by the rapid turnover of intracellular metabolites
	and the need to quench metabolism and separate metabolites from the
	extracellular space. We therefore focused instead on direct, noninvasive,
	mass spectrometric monitoring of extracellular metabolites in spent
	culture medium. Metabolic footprinting can distinguish between different
	physiological states of wildtype yeast and between yeast single-gene
	deletion mutants even from related areas of metabolism. By using
	appropriate clustering and machine learning techniques, the latter
	based on genetic programming(2-8), we show that metabolic footprinting
	is an effective method to classify 'unknown' mutants by genetic defect.},

  abstract = {Nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay (NMD) is triggered by premature
	translation termination(1-3), but the features distinguishing premature
	from normal termination are unknown. One model for NMD suggests that
	decay-inducing factors bound to {mRNA}s during early processing events
	are routinely removed by elongating ribosomes but remain associated
	with {mRNA}s when termination is premature, triggering rapid turnover(4).
	Recent experiments(5-7) challenge this notion and suggest a model
	that posits that {mRNA} decay is activated by the intrinsically aberrant
	nature of premature termination(8,9). Here we use a primer extension
	inhibition ( toeprinting) assay(10) to delineate ribosome positioning
	and find that premature translation termination in yeast extracts
	is indeed aberrant. Ribosomes encountering premature UAA or UGA codons
	in the CAN1 {mRNA} fail to release and, instead, migrate to upstream
	AUGs. This anomaly depends on prior nonsense codon recognition and
	is eliminated in extracts derived from cells lacking the principal
	NMD factor, Upf1p, or by flanking the nonsense codon with a normal
	3' - untranslated region (UTR). Tethered poly(A)-binding protein
	(Pab1p), used as a mimic of a normal 3'-UTR, recruits the termination
	factor Sup35p (eRF3) and stabilizes nonsense-containing {mRNA}s.
	These findings indicate that efficient termination and {mRNA} stability

	has been performed based on Jeger's linked differential equations.
	Some important, well-established epidemiological principles and concepts
	have been 'rediscovered', clarified or redefined. A new variable,
	defined as total inoculum reservoir of the host, is suggested as
	an additional epidemiological concept. Three rate parameters with
	phytopathological meaning were included in the system: R the constant
	intrinsic infection rate comparable to the Vanderplankian R(c), h
	pathogen's 'hatching rate', related to the mean latent period p and
	g the intrinsic removal rate related to the infectious period i.
	Another parameter lambda(1) is empirical and comparable to the logarithmic
	infection rate, sensu Vanderplank if time becomes very large. In
	the compartment system iR = 0 is a threshold condition for total
	disease to increase over initial disease level and iR = 1 is a threshold
	condition for an 'explosive' total disease increase that may induce
	a large epidemic rather than a threshold for total disease to start

	a finite value, while when iR > 1, the total disease increase is
	explosive; only where lambda, = root dh does this increase follows
	the exponential law at larger t, otherwise the exponential law with

  abstract = {Background. Epidemiologists are often interested in estimating the
	risk of several related diseases as well as adverse outcomes, which
	have a natural ordering of severity or certainty. While most investigators
	choose to model several dichotomous outcomes (such as very low birthweight
	versus normal and moderately low birthweight versus normal), this
	approach does not fully utilize the available information. Several
	statistical models for ordinal responses have been proposed, but
	have been underutilized. In this paper, we describe statistical methods
	for modelling ordinal response data, and illustrate the fit of these
	models to a large database from a perinatal health programme. Methods.
	Models considered here include (1) the cumulative logit model, (2)
	continuation-ratio model, (3) constrained and unconstrained partial
	proportional odds models, (4) adjacent-category logit model, (5)
	polytomous logistic model, and (6) stereotype logistic model. We
	illustrate and compare the fit of these models on a perinatal database,
	to study the impact of midline episiotomy procedure on perineal lacerations
	during labour and delivery. Finally, we provide a discussion on graphical
	methods for the assessment of model assumptions and model constraints,
	and conclude with a discussion on the choice of an ordinal model.
	The primary focus in this paper is the formulation of ordinal models,
	interpretation of model parameters, and their implications for epidemiological
	research. Conclusions. This paper presents a synthesized review of
	generalized linear regression models for analysing ordered responses.
	We recommend that the analyst performs (i) goodness-of-fit tests
	and an analysis of residuals, (ii) sensitivity analysis by fitting
	and comparing different models, and (iii) by graphically examining
	the model assumptions.}

	as $\alpha \uparrow$ the parasite also fails to regulate the host
	population, this is because there is a reduction in the mean infection

	i.e. more uniform than poisson, always lead to unstable equilibrium.

	at equilibrium $N^* = A/(\mu + \alpha)$ if disease can persist (drop
	$\alpha$ if it can't). Disease persistance is determined by whether
	or not $A\land mu >< \beta/(\alpha + \mu + \nu)$, if the $>$ holds
	then parasite should depress pop. size until $R_0 = 1$ or equivalently
	until $N^*$ given above holds (haven't checked). They, perhaps, produce
	a number of implicit parasite fitness landscapes. Looking at $N^*$
	as theoretically predicted vs. $\alpha$, though it doesn't appear
	that they assume any trade off between $\alpha$ and $\beta$, it not
	clear how $N^*$ and $S^*$ are related but are highly likely to be
	correlated. They note: " the maxi. depression of hte host opo. is
	achieved by a disease of intermediate pathogenicity." and that the
	obs. $\alpha$ value is pretty close to the min. $N^*$ but don't really
	know what that means at this point. Now move on to theory where they
	ignore immigration, but allow host births to occur and try to address
	3 main questions: (a) what biol. charact. of an infection determin
	its impact on host pop. growth, (b) what are the pop. conseq. of
	inmmuno. reponses, and (3) what cond. lead to endemic or epidemic
	infect? If disease can't reg. pop. it will still spread and all of
	the expon. growing hosts will either asymptotically approach being
	infect. or recovered. One problem with this model is the lack of
	units. For instance, in the section "Pop. conseq. of immune responses"
	they discuss a threshold density of 340,000, but don't mention units
	(implicit is that its around 7 more dense than the inital population
	density of 50,000, but again how that is set is unclear). Note: endemics
	are stable, persistant level of infection w/in a population while
	epidemics are unstable, rapid spread and then decline of an infection.
	Stochastic factors may be important in driving epidemic cycles, esp.
	in situations where the population growth rate is much less than
	the added mort. rate of the disease. Infection sweeps through, is
	essentially lost via stoch. events, population builds up to above
	threshold density, disease is eventually reintroduced, epidemic occurs,
	etc. If instead added mort and pop. growth are about equal then one
	expects the case of an endemic disease. "\ldots lit is important
	to remember that hosts with high rates of reproduction, such as arthrodpods,
	may be able to support endemic disease even if population density
	is low." }

	Here we analyse the consequences of within-host evolutionary changes.
	We build an epidemiological model where infections are regularly
	invaded by locally favored mutations affecting various infectious
	traits (virulence, transmissibility and clearance). Our results are
	the following. In durable infections, where within-host evolution
	is an important matter, a drop of transmissibility is only slightly
	deleterious to the infection, while a reduction of infection lifespan
	is very costly. In consequence, locally favored mutations reducing
	transmissibility reach a larger frequency, or even the complete fixation,
	and the suboptimality accumulated in infections owing to within-host
	evolution affects more their transmission than their duration. Conversely,
	taking an infection at random and observing the events of within-host
	evolution, one is more likely to observe reductions of infection
	length than reductions of transmissibility, because the mutations
	affecting transmissibility are often already present in infections.
	We then discuss the interpretation of these results in terms of deleterious
	mutations, and we also emphasize that the management of within-host
	evolution could be used as a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment

	Attraction of insects by pseudo-flowers or sugary secretions also
	serves to spread many diseases. Given the diversity of processes
	involved, a simple all-encompassing parallel with animal venereal
	diseases is not possible. Operationally establishing the routes of
	disease transmission, as well as quantifying the relative magnitudes
	of these different routes, remains critical for understanding disease
	dynamics and controlling spread in agricultural contexts. From an
	axiomatic viewpoint, sexually transmitted diseases are characterized
	by frequency-dependent transmission, transmission in the adult stage,
	and by virulence effects involving sterility rather than mortality.
	These characteristics serve to differentiate the dynamics and evolution
	of sexually transmitted diseases from that of other diseases and
	are features that are also shared by many pollinator-transmitted
	diseases. However, the majority of plant diseases that involve the
	reproductive structures show a rich biology that defies easy categorization.
	The experimental convenience of plants and their pathogens is likely

	no polymorphic equilibrium exists under these conditions". Apparently
	this is similar to what Jayakar (1970) found. Discussion: "the expectation
	that hihgly resistant ind. should incur a correspondingly high cost
	to coexist with susceptibles is not borne out." This is because there
	is density dependent host growth and, therefore, the resistant hosts
	reduce the force of infection by diluting the suscept. population.
	Region of polymorphism becomes more restricted as the two genotypes
	become more similar in their suscept. "This is because the intro.
	of an alternative allele that differs only slightly in resistance
	has little effect on the disease incidence." It follows that one
	would expect to find extreme, rather than slight, differences in
	variation in natural populations which is apparently the case. Cite
	Kemper (1982) "It is interesting that the equilibrium numbers of
	diseased individual in the density-dependent transmission case is
	simply the cost-benefit ratio and independent of $\gamma$ (the degree

	(Microbotryum violaceum) on the plant genus Silene (Caryophyllaceae).
	This system has little direct social impact, and it is readily amenable
	to experimental manipulation. Our microevolutionary studies have
	focused on the host shift of Microbotryum from Silene alba (= latifolia;
	white campion) onto Silene vulgaris (bladder campion) in a population
	in Virginia. Karyotypic variation shows that the host shift is recent
	and originates from the disease on sympatric S. alba. Analysis of
	the spatial pattern of disease shows that the host shift has been
	contingent on the co-occurrence of the two species at a local scale.
	Cross-inoculation studies show that families of the new host differ
	greatly in their susceptibility to the pathogen, indicating the potential
	for rapid evolution of resistance. Disease expression on the new
	host is frequently abnormal, suggesting that the pathogen is imperfectly
	adapted to its new host. In experimental populations, disease transmission
	within populations of the old host is greater than within populations
	of the new host. However, there is also a high transmission rate
	of the disease from the new host back to the old host, suggesting
	a feedback effect that increases disease prevalence in the community
	as a whole. Continuing studies of these populations are designed
	to determine whether this new host-pathogen system is likely to be
	self-sustaining and to quantify evolutionary changes in both the

	of viral strains in the myxomatosis case. Myxomatosis, a highly lethal
	disease of the European rabbit, has been used in Australia and Europe
	as a biological control of rabbit populations. A few years after
	its introduction, the original highly virulent strains were almost
	completely replaced by field strains covering a wide range of virulence.
	Here, we study several mechanisms that may explain the field observations.
	First we considered spatial heterogeneity. The establishment of any
	strain over regions occupied by host populations may delay the spread
	of any superior competitive virus strain, producing global coexistence
	in the long term. On the other hand, sub-populations with different
	resistance levels in epidemiological contact, as observed in the
	field, can maintain several different virus strains co-circulating.
	The second class of mechanism introduces diversity among hosts of
	a local population sharing a territory. We considered different classes
	of host resistance to myxomatosis: belonging to a resistance class
	is a random fact. Host age-dependent resistance is also especially
	considered. These types of population heterogeneity can sustain local
	coexistence for many years, although exclusion takes place for long
	enough periods. The concurrent action of both types of mechanisms
	could explain why the diversity of virus strains is sustained, and
	the local coexistence. Finally, we briefly discuss the influence
	of host genetic dynamics in the coevolution of the system. }

	Proteins are gene products, and at the level of genes, duplication,
	recombination, fusion and fission are the processes that produce
	new genes. We attempt to gain an overview of these processes by studying
	the evolutionary units in proteins, domains, in the protein sequences
	of 40 genomes. The domain and superfamily definitions in the Structural
	Classification of Proteins Database are used, so that we can view
	all pairs of adjacent domains in genome sequences in terms of their
	superfamily combinations. We find 783 out of the 859 superfamilies
	in SCOP in these genomes, and the 783 families occur in 1307 pairwise
	combinations. Most families are observed in combination with one
	or two other families, while a few families are very versatile in
	their combinatorial behaviour; 209 families do not make combinations
	with other families. This type of pattern can be described as a scale-free
	network. We also study the N to C-terminal orientation of domain
	pairs and domain repeats. The phylogenetic distribution of domain
	combinations is surveyed, to establish the extent of common and kingdom-specific
	combinations. Of the kingdom-specific combinations, significantly
	more combinations consist of families present in all three kingdoms
	than of families present in one or two kingdoms. Hence, we are led
	to conclude that recombination between common families, as compared
	to the invention of new families and recombination among these, has
	also been a major contribution to the evolution of kingdom-specific
	and species-specific functions in organisms in all three kingdoms.
	Finally, we compare the set of the domain combinations in the genomes
	to those in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, and discuss the implications
	for structural genomics.},

  abstract = {Translation of an {mRNA} is generally divided into three stages: initiation,
	elongation and termination. The relative rates of these steps determine
	both the number and position of ribosomes along the {mRNA}, but traditional
	velocity sedimentation assays for the translational status of {mRNA}
	determine only the number of bound ribosomes. We developed a procedure,
	termed Ribosome Density Mapping (RDM), that uses site-specific cleavage
	of polysomal {mRNA} followed by separation on a sucrose gradient
	and northern analysis, to determine the number of ribosomes associated
	with specified portions of a particular {mRNA}. This procedure allows
	us to test models for translation and its control, and to examine
	properties of individual steps of translation \emph{in vivo}. We
	tested specific predictions from the current model for translational
	control of GCN4 expression in yeast and found that ribosomes were
	differentially associated with the uORFs elements and coding region
	under different growth conditions, consistent with this model. We
	also mapped ribosome density along the ORF of several {mRNA}s, to
	probe basic kinetic properties of translational steps in yeast. We
	found no detectable decline in ribosome density between the 5' and
	3' ends of the ORFs, suggesting that the average processivity of
	elongation is very high. Conversely, there was no queue of ribosomes
	at the termination site, suggesting that termination is not very
	slow relative to elongation and initiation. Finally, the RDM results
	suggest that less frequent initiation of translation on {mRNA}s with
	longer ORFs is responsible for the inverse correlation between ORF
	length and ribosomal density that we observed in a global analysis
	of translation. These results provide new insights into eukaryotic
	translation \emph{in vivo}. },

	codes that compete to invade the population by translating its genes
	with higher fitness. Codes and genes coevolve in a succession of
	stages, alternating between genetic equilibration and code invasion,
	from an initial wholly ambiguous coding state to a diversified frozen
	coding state. Our simulations almost always resulted in partially

	at equilibrium, the positive selection of the same codon in different
	types of sites, and translational ambiguity-predispose the evolution

	that the number of offspring is unknown and can be represented as
	a random variable. There are 3 basic assumptions. The first assumption
	is that a given body of resources can be divided into consumption
	(yielding satisfaction) and transfer to children. The second assumption
	is that the parents' welfare includes a concern for the welfare of
	their children; this is recursive in the sense that the children's
	welfares include concern for their children and so forth. However,
	the welfare of a child from a given consumption is counted somewhat
	differently (generally less) than that of the parent (the welfare
	of a child is "discounted"). The third assumption is that resources
	transferred may grow (or decline). In economic language, investment,
	including that in education or nutrition, is productive. Under suitable
	restrictions, precise formulas for the resulting allocation of resources
	are found, demonstrating that, depending on the shape of the utility

	Heme arising from the degradation of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and of

	Albumin, haptoglobin, hemopexin, and high and low density lipoproteins
	cooperate to trap the plasma heme, thereby ensuring its complete

	cells only after internalization of the hemopexin-heme complex by
	CD91 receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, alpha(1)-microglobulin
	contributes to heme degradation by a still unknown mechanism, with
	the concomitant formation of heterogeneous yellow-brown kynurenine-derived
	chromophores which are very tightly bound to amino acid residues
	close to the rim of the lipocalin pocket. During hemoglobin synthesis,
	the erythroid alpha-chain hemoglobin-stabilizing protein specifically

	carrying each natural of synthetic {tRNA} gene harbouring an anticodon

	the conversion of adenosine 34 to inosine 34. The homologous E. coli
	enzyme modifies adenosine 34 only in {tRNA}s with an arginine anticodon
	ACG. The base conversion occurs by a hydrolytic deamination-type
	reaction. This was determined by reversed phase high-pressure liquid
	chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction
	product after \emph{in vitro} modification in [O-18]water. This newly
	characterised {tRNA}:adenosine 34 deaminase was partially purified
	from yeast. It has a molecular mass of approximately 75 kDa, and
	it does not require any cofactor, except magnesium ions, to deaminate
	adenosine 34 efficiently in {tRNA}. The observed dependence of the
	enzymatic reaction on magnesium ions probably reflects the need for
	a correct {tRNA} architecture. Enzymatic recognition of {tRNA} does
	not depend on the presence of any ''identity'' nucleoside other than
	adenosine 34. Likewise, the presence of pseudouridine 32 or 1-methyl-guanosine
	37 in the anticodon loop does not interfere with inosine 34 biosynthesis.
	However, the efficacy of adenosine 34 to inosine 34 conversion depends
	on the nucleotide sequence of the anticodon loop and its proximal
	stem, the best {tRNA} substrates being those with a purine at position
	35. Mutations that affect the size of the anticodon loop or one of
	several three-dimensional base-pairs abolish the capacity of the
	{tRNA} to be substrate for the yeast {tRNA}:adenosine 34 deaminase.
	Evidently, the activity of yeast {tRNA}:adenosine 34 deaminase depends
	more on the global structural feature (conformational stability/flexibility)
	of the L-shaped {tRNA} substrates than on the identity of any particular
	nucleotide other than adenosine 34. An apparent K-m of 2.3 nM for
	its natural substrate {tRNA}(Ser) (anticodon AGA) was measured. Altogether,
	these results suggest that a single enzyme can account for the presence
	of inosine 34 in all seven cytoplasmic A34-containing precursor {tRNA}s

	reveals 198 interactions among 222 proteins common to both data sets,

	that a "spoke" model that directly pairs bait proteins with associated
	proteins is roughly threefold more accurate than a "matrix" model
	that connects all proteins. In addition, we identify a large, previously
	unsuspected nucleolar complex of 148 proteins, including 39 proteins

	The size and the sequence of the nucleotide-protected fragment depends
	on the location of the ARS within the 5'-UTR. When the ARS is located

	Most published methods for identifying differential expression focus

	stock of brown trout Salmo trutta where only innately resistant individuals
	were found. A general feature of salmonid infections is the considerable
	variation of susceptibility between individual fish of the same stock,
	which appears genetic in origin. The parasite seems to be generally
	unable to reproduce on non-salmonids, and on cyprinids, individual
	behavioural mechanisms of the parasite may prevent infection. Transmission

	applied to directional selection on an additive trait, this gives
	a very good approximation to the evolution of the trait mean and
	the genetic variance, when the number of mutations per generation

  journal = {Bmc Evolutionary Biology},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Background: Since thermodynamic stability is a global property of
	proteins that has to be conserved during evolution, the selective
	pressure at a given site of a protein sequence depends on the amino
	acids present at other sites. However, models of molecular evolution
	that aim at reconstructing the evolutionary history of macromolecules
	become computationally intractable if such correlations between sites
	are explicitly taken into account. Results: We introduce an evolutionary
	model with sites evolving independently under a global constraint
	on the conservation of structural stability. This model consists
	of a selection process, which depends on two hydrophobicity parameters
	that can be computed from protein sequences without any fit, and
	a mutation process for which we consider various models. It reproduces
	quantitatively the results of Structurally Constrained Neutral (SCN)
	simulations of protein evolution in which the stability of the native
	state is explicitly computed and conserved. We then compare the predicted
	site-specific amino acid distributions with those sampled from the
	Protein Data Bank (PDB). The parameters of the mutation model, whose
	number varies between zero and five, are fitted from the data. The
	mean correlation coefficient between predicted and observed site-specific
	amino acid distributions is larger than < r > = 0.70 for a mutation
	model with no free parameters and no genetic code. In contrast, considering
	only the mutation process with no selection yields a mean correlation
	coefficient of < r > = 0.56 with three fitted parameters. The mutation
	model that best fits the data takes into account increased mutation
	rate at CpG dinucleotides, yielding < r > = 0.90 with five parameters.
	Conclusion: The effective selection process that we propose reproduces
	well amino acid distributions as observed in the protein sequences
	in the PDB. Its simplicity makes it very promising for likelihood
	calculations in phylogenetic studies. Interestingly, in this approach
	the mutation process influences the effective selection process,
	i. e. selection and mutation must be entangled in order to obtain
	effectively independent sites. This interdependence between mutation
	and selection reflects the deep influence that mutation has on the
	evolutionary process: The bias in the mutation influences the thermodynamic
	properties of the evolving proteins, in agreement with comparative
	studies of bacterial proteomes, and it also influences the rate of
	accepted mutations. },

  abstract = {Humans and animals often become coinfected with pathogen strains that

	on virulence genes in pathogen populations. Many mathematical analyses
	of this assume that virulent pathogen lineages have a competitive

	will evolve to become more virulent where genetically diverse infections
	are common. Although the implications of these studies are relevant
	to both fundamental biology and medical science, direct empirical
	tests for relationships between virulence and competitive ability
	are lacking. Here we use newly developed strain-specific real-time
	quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocols to determine the

	more virulent a clone was relative to its competitor, the less it
	suffered from competition. This result confirms our earlier work

	of many theoretical models. To the extent that our rodent model captures

	These interactions take place in secondary lymphoid tissues, such

	of these tissues plays a crucial role in the development of immune
	responses. Two-photon microscopy ( 2PM) imaging in LNs suggests that
	T cells walk in a consistent direction for several minutes, pause

  abstract = {To initiate an adaptive immune response, T cells need to interact
	with dendritic cells (DCs), and the duration of these interactions
	plays an important role. In vitro and in vivo experiments have generally
	tried to estimate the required period of opportunity for T cell stimulation
	rather than the duration of individual T cell-DC interactions. Since
	the application of multi-photon microscopy (MPM) to living lymphoid
	tissues, the interactions between immune cells, as well as the duration
	thereof, can directly be observed in vivo. Indeed, long-lasting interactions
	between T cells and DCs were shown to be important for the onset
	of immune responses. However, because MPM imaging is typically restricted
	to experiments lasting 1 h, and because T cell-DC conjugates frequently
	move into and out of the imaged volume, it is difficult to estimate
	the true duration of interactions from MPM contact data. Here, we
	present a method to properly make such an estimate of (the average
	of) the distribution of contact durations. We validate the method
	by applying it to spatially explicit computer simulations where the
	true distribution of contact duration is known. Finally, we apply
	our analysis to a large experimental data set of T-DC contacts, and
	predict an average contact time of about three hours. However, we
	identify a mismatch between the experimental data and the model predictions,
	and investigate possible causes of the mismatch, including minor

  abstract = {Background: The regulation of a gene depends on the binding of transcription
	factors to specific sites located in the regulatory region of the
	gene. The generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity
	between them are essential building blocks in the evolution of complex
	regulatory networks. We study a theoretical model for the sequence
	evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The approach is based
	on biophysical models for the binding of transcription factors to
	DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which
	enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift,
	and selection. Results: We show that the selection for factor binding
	generically leads to specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies
	at different positions of a binding site. We demonstrate the possibility
	of rapid adaptive evolution generating a new binding site for a given
	transcription factor by point mutations. The evolutionary time required
	is estimated in terms of the neutral ( background) mutation rate,
	the selection coefficient, and the effective population size. Conclusions:
	The efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on two
	joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and
	the promoter region must be long enough. These constraints on promoter
	architecture are indeed seen in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore,
	we analyse the adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal
	integration through binding cooperativity between different sites.
	Experimental tests of this picture involving the statistics of polymorphisms
	and phylogenies of sites are discussed.},

	general objective of this review is to complement earlier literature
	syntheses on this topic by focusing on MHC studies other than humans

	from making better use of the increasing number of models potentially
	offering more statistical rigour and higher resolution in detecting

	patterns of MHC diversity within and among natural populations with
	neutral expectations have reported higher population differentiation
	at MHC than expected either under neutrality or simple models of
	balancing selection. Fourthly, several studies showed that MHC-dependent

	maintaining polymorphism in wild outbred populations. However, they
	also showed that such reproductive mechanisms are complex and context-based.
	Fifthly, several studies provided evidence that MHC may significantly

	increases the silent GC content of a genome in a selectively neutral
	manner, resulting in a highly significant positive correlation between
	recombination and "GC3s" in the yeast \emph{{S}accharomyces cerevisiae}.
	Neither selection nor mutation can explain this relationship. A highly
	significant GC-biased mismatch repair system is documented for the
	first time in any member of the Kingdom Fungi. Much of the variation
	in the GC3s within yeast appears to result from GC-biased gene conversion.
	Evidence suggests that GC-biased mismatch repair exists in numerous
	organisms spanning six kingdoms. This transkingdom GC mismatch repair
	bias may have evolved in response to a ubiquitous AT mutational bias.
	A significant positive correlation between recombination and GC content
	is found in many of these same organisms, suggesting that the processes
	influencing the evolution of the yeast genome may be a general phenomenon.
	Nonrecombining regions of the genome and nonrecombining genomes would
	not be subject to this type of molecular drive. It is suggested that
	the low GC content characteristic of many nonrecombining genomes
	may be the result of three processes (1) a prevailing AT mutational
	bias, (2) random fixation of the most common types of mutation, and
	(3) the absence of the GC-biased gene conversion which, in recombining
	organisms, permits the reversal of the most common types of mutation.
	A model is proposed to explain the observation that introns, intergenic
	regions, and pseudogenes typically have lower GC content than the
	silent sites of corresponding open reading frames. This model is
	based on the observation that the greater the heterology between
	two sequences, the less likely it is that recombination will occur
	between them. According to this "Constraint" hypothesis, the formation
	and propagation of heteroduplex DNA is expected to occur, on average,
	more frequently within conserved coding and regulatory regions of
	the genome. In organisms possessing GC-biased mismatch repair, this
	would enhance the GC content of these regions through biased gene
	conversion. These findings have a number of important implications

	persistent fluctuations (endemic dynamics) in large British cities,
	and recurrent outbreaks (episodic dynamics) in smaller communities.
	The critical community size separating the two regimes was similar
	to300 000-500 000. We develop a model, the TSIR (Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered)
	model, that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks
	in measles. The model includes the stochasticity inherent in the
	disease transmission (giving rise to a negative binomial conditional
	distribution) and random immigration. It is thus a doubly stochastic
	model for disease dynamics. It further includes seasonality in the
	transmission rates. All parameters of the model are estimated on
	the basis of time series data on reported cases and reconstructed
	susceptible numbers from a set of cities in England and Wales in
	the prevaccination era (1944-1966). The 60 cities analyzed span a
	size range from London (3.3 X 10(6) inhabitants) to Teignmouth (10
	500 inhabitants). The dynamics of all cities fit the model well.
	Transmission rates scale with community size, as expected from dynamics
	adhering closely to frequency dependent transmission ("true mass
	action"). These rates are further found to reveal strong seasonal
	variation, corresponding to high transmission during school terms
	and lower transmission during the school holidays. The basic reproductive
	ratio, R, is found to be invariant across the observed range of host
	community size, and the mean proportion of susceptible individuals
	also appears to be constant. Through the epidemic cycle, the susceptible
	population is kept within a 3\% interval. The disease is, thus. efficient
	in "regulating" the susceptible population-even in small cities that
	undergo recurrent epidemics with frequent extinction of the disease
	agent. Recolonization is highly sensitive to the random immigration
	process. The initial phase of the epidemic is also stochastic (due
	to demographic stochasticity and random immigration). However, the
	epidemic is nearly "deterministic" through most of the growth and
	decline phase. }

	Students are thus encouraged to assess or reassess evolution in terms
	of what they already consider to be true from their own experiences.
	Preliminary results (two trial runs) using this questionnaire indicate
	that students readily apply information with which they are familiar
	to Darwinian principles, and vice versa. These results, including
	verbal and written comments, also suggest that this 'test' may be

  abstract = {It is often anticipated that many of today's diploid plant species
	are in fact paleopolyploids. Given that an ancient large-scale duplication
	will result in an excess of relatively old duplicated genes with
	similar ages, we analyzed the timing of duplication of pairs of paralogous
	genes in 14 model plant species. Using EST contigs (unigenes), we
	identified pairs of paralogous genes in each species and used the
	level of synonymous nucleotide substitution to estimate the relative
	ages of gene duplication. For nine of the investigated species (wheat
	[Triticum aestivum], maize [Zea mays], tetraploid cotton [Gossypium
	hirsutum], diploid cotton [G. arboretum], tomato [Lycopersicon esculentum],
	potato [Solanum tuberosum], soybean [Glycine max], barrel medic [Medicago
	truncatula], and Arabidopsis thaliana), the age distributions of
	duplicated genes contain peaks corresponding to short evolutionary
	periods during which large numbers of duplicated genes were accumulated.
	Large-scale duplications (polyploidy or aneuploidy) are strongly
	suspected to be the cause of these temporal peaks of gene duplication.
	However, the unusual age profile of tandem gene duplications in Arabidopsis
	indicates that other scenarios, such as variation in the rate at
	which duplicated genes are deleted, must also be considered. },

  abstract = {An absence of genetic variance in traits under selection is perhaps
	the oldest explanation for a limit to evolutionary change, but has
	also been the most easily dismissed. We review a range of theoretical
	and empirical results covering single traits to more complex multivariate
	systems, and show that an absence of genetic variance may be more
	common than is currently appreciated. From a single-trait perspective,
	we highlight that it is becoming clear that some trait types do not
	display significant levels of genetic variation, and we raise the
	possibility that species with restricted ranges may differ qualitatively
	from more widespread species in levels of genetic variance in ecologically
	important traits. A common misconception in many life-history studies
	is that a lack of genetic variance in single traits, and genetic
	constraints as a consequence of bivariate genetic correlations, are
	different causes of selection limits. We detail how interpretations
	of bivariate patterns are unlikely to demonstrate genetic limits
	to selection in many cases. We advocate a multivariate definition
	of genetic constraints that emphasizes the presence (or otherwise)
	of genetic variance in the multivariate direction of selection. For
	multitrait systems, recent results using longer term studies of organisms,
	in which more is understood concerning what traits may be under selection,

	an example of an extraordinarily dynamic process with an extreme
	sensitivity of the phenotype of infection to parameters of virus/host
	interaction. A mathematical model is developed to examine the dynamics
	of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response for LCMV
	infection in mice. The model, formulated by a system of nonlinear
	delay-differential equations, considers the interacting populations
	of viruses, precursor CTLs, terminally differentiated effector CTLs
	and total virus antigen load. Clonal elimination of virus-specific
	cytotoxic T cells in high-dose LCMV-Docile infection represents an
	example of the classical phenomenon-high tone tolerance. To describe
	both conventional and exhaustive CTL responses in the acute phase
	of LCMV-D infection two mechanisms are invoked: the high virus antigen
	load inhibition of T-cell proliferation via anergy induction and
	the activation-induced cell death by apoptosis. Parameters of the
	model, characterizing the rates of virus and CTL production and elimination
	in spleen, are estimated by assimilating with the model data on the

	infections. It is suggested that not only the clonal expansions have
	to be described in mathematical models as being virus regulated but
	also the later phases of primary immune response. Down-regulation
	of the primary CTL response is controlled by a network of mechanisms
	inducing anergy and apoptosis in activated T cells. The model is
	used to investigate the effect of variations in virus and CTL response
	parameters on LCMV infection outcome and suggest predictions for
	experimental studies, in particular the phenotype of LCMV-WE infection

  abstract = {Parasites reproduce and are subject to natural selection at several
	different, but intertwined, levels. In the recent paper, Gilchrist
	and Coombs (Theor. Popul. Biol. 69:145-153, 2006) relate the between-host
	transmission in the context of an SI model to the dynamics within
	a host. They demonstrate that within-host selection may lead to an
	outcome that differs from the outcome of selection at the host population
	level. In this paper we combine the two levels of reproduction by
	considering the possibility of superinfection and study the evolution
	of the pathogen's within-host reproduction rate p. We introduce a
	superinfection function phi= phi(p,q), giving the probability with
	which pathogens with trait q, upon transmission to a host that is
	already infected by pathogens with trait p, "take over" the host.
	We consider three cases according to whether the function q --> phi(p,q)
	(i) has a discontinuity, (ii) is continuous, but not differentiable,
	or (iii) is differentiable in q = p. We find that in case (i) the
	within-host selection dominates in the sense that the outcome of
	evolution at the host population level coincides with the outcome
	of evolution in a single infected host. In case (iii), it is the
	transmission to susceptible hosts that dominates the evolution to
	the extent that the singular strategies are the same as when the
	possibility of superinfections is ignored. In the biologically most
	relevant case (ii), both forms of reproduction contribute to the
	value of a singular trait. We show that when phi is derived from
	a branching process variant of the submodel for the within-host interaction
	of pathogens and target cells, the superinfection functions fall
	under case (ii). We furthermore demonstrate that the superinfection
	model allows for steady coexistence of pathogen traits at the host

  abstract = {Background: Superinfections are known to facilitate the co-existence
	of several pathogen strains in a host population. Previous models
	have demonstrated that pathogen virulence may undergo evolutionary
	branching, whereby an ancestral strain splits into two strains of
	different virulence. Evolutionary branching depends on the superinfection
	function as well as the trade-off between virulence and transmission,
	but reliable empirical data for these functions are scarce. Aim:
	To find necessary and sufficient conditions for evolutionary branching
	in an SI model (where S stands for susceptible and I for infected/infectious)
	with superinfections under any conceivable transmission-virulence
	trade-on. Methods: Adaptive dynamics and critical function analysis.
	Assumptions: The superinfection function is assumed to be differentiable,
	but otherwise arbitrary. We consider three different modes of host
	Population dynamics: constant population size, constant population
	birth rate, and logistic population growth in the absence of pathogens.
	Results: In the constant population birth rate model, evolutionary
	branching can always Occur if the convexity of the trade-off falls
	in a certain range; this range can however be narrow, especially
	if the singularity is at high virulence and relatively low transmission.
	With constant Population size and with logistic growth, mutual exclusion
	of strains occurs near some singularities, which excludes evolutionary
	branching in part of the parameter space. Comparison of methods:
	We show how critical function analysis relates to a more traditional
	analysis of the model via pairwise invasibility plots and bifurcation
	plots of evolutionary singularities.},

	(1990) found slower developmental times for I. meal moth resistant
	to granulosis virus. Here data was taken from an experiment by Sait
	(1992) in which 3 host populations evolved in the presence of the
	virus and 3 evolved in the absence of it for a 2 year period. A probit
	analysis found evidence for the evolution of resistance in the exposed
	pop. Also found increased development time and weight for pupae of
	resistant pops. No change in number of eggs laid but a decrease in
	egg viabililty. Interestingly, increase in developmental time was
	found for the instars in which there was also an significant increase
	in resistance, while develop. times for instars in which resistance
	didn't evolve didn't change. Total fitness decrease in absence of
	virus of selected pop was approx 15PERCENT. They then calculate that
	resistance will be advantageous if the survivorship of the resistant,
	in the presence of the virus, is "1.052 times greater than that of
	the susceptible morph." Which I don't understand since one needs
	to really take into account the prevalence of the infection. My guess

	to the disease." This is in contrast to our work which looks at the

	coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes
	in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans)

	effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective
	effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations,
	the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution
	of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near
	neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29\% of amino acid changing

	30-42\% are moderately deleterious (0.01\%<|s|<1\%), and nearly all

  abstract = {The native structure of hemoglobin (Hb) comprises two alphaand two
	beta-subunits, each of which carries a heme group. There appear to
	be no previous studies that report the in vitro folding and assembly
	of Hb from highly unfolded alpha- and beta-globin in a "one-pot"
	reaction. One difficulty that has to be overcome for studies of this
	kind is the tendency of Hb to aggregate during refolding. This work
	demonstrates that denaturation of Hb in 40\% acetonitrile at pH 10.0
	is reversible. A dialysis-mediated solvent change to a purely aqueous
	environment of pH 8.0 results in Hb refolding without any apparent
	aggregation. Fluorescence, Soret absorption, circular dichroism,
	and ESI mass spectra of the protein recorded before unfolding and
	after refolding are almost identical. By employing an externally
	pressurized dialysis cell that is coupled on-line to an ESI mass
	spectrometer, changes in heme binding behavior, protein conformation,
	and quaternary structure can be monitored as a function of time.
	The process occurs in a stepwise sequential manner, leading from
	monomeric alpha- and beta-globin to heterodimeric species, which
	then assemble into tetramers. Overall, this mechanism is consistent
	with previous studies employing the mixing of folded alpha- and beta-globin.
	However, some unexpected features are observed, e.g., a heme-deficient
	beta-globin dimer that represents an off-pathway intermediate. Monomeric
	beta-globin is capable of binding heme before forming a complex with
	an alpha-subunit. This observation suggests that holo-alpha-apo-beta
	globin does not represent an obligatory intermediate during Hb assembly,
	as had been proposed previously. The on-line dialysis/ESI-MS approach
	developed for this work represents a widely applicable tool for studying
	the folding and self-assembly of noncovalent biological complexes.

	In intro they cite some interesting sounding studies looking at variation

	that one way to test whether or not a pathogen is at its max virulence
	(i.e. cant evolve to be more virulent even if selection was for greater
	levels) is through serial passages.Stairs 1973 = good survey of \emph{Baculovirus}
	virulence variation. Shapiro and Ignoffo 1970 for variation in of
	same genus on the cotton bollworm. Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965 for
	coevolution of both myxoma and rabbits. B\&P's findings: When nash
	equil. exists there can be coexistance of multiple parasites, if
	it doesn't exist then you get contiunual invasion by ever more virulent
	parasites. " For a broad range of infections diseases it can be assumed
	that the transmission trate and the disease induced mortality rate
	depend on the reproductive rate ($\lambda$) of the parasites, such
	that $\beta(\lambda)$ and $\alpha(\lambda)$ are monotonic increasing
	function of $\lambda$." Here reproduction apparently means the production
	of transmission propagules. "More generally, increases in host mortality
	with the size of parasitic infection are well documented from laboratory
	studies." no refs. B\&P functionally link $\alpha$ to $\lambda$ --
	should cite for this. Assume that transmission is proportional to
	reproductive output of parasite, i.e. $\beta \propto \beta_e \lambda$.
	The implicitly ignore replication of parasite population within a
	host. Assume that $\alpha(\lambda)$ is convex upward, i.e. accelerating
	and use a quadratic function (but also mention more complex case
	where its an infinite polynomial which should describe any function).
	Come up with an optimal birth rate which will be infinite if the
	term if the relationship is linear. Also mention that in general
	if $\nu$ is 0 then it will select for less virulent parasites. (i.e.
	recovery becomes independent of $\alpha$, imagining, I assume, a
	step function of some sort) Competing strains within a host: Assuming
	interactions between parasite effects (i.e. parasite damage is not
	additive across strains) then $\alpha = (\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \lambda_i)^2$
	then there is no nash equilibrium and selection favors ever increasing
	parsite reproductive rates. This makes since since due to the non-additivities
	of strain added mortality. Looking at additive case and others they
	find that if the exponent is greater than 2, presumably, then you
	can have a nash equilibrium iff the exponent term is greater than
	the number of competeting strains.}

	antigens, thus creating a barrier against continual infection and
	restricting burden size within the host. CI offers an important potential
	benefit to established worms by preventing overcrowding within the

	to a problem of collective action. Here, we build on earlier analytical
	findings about the evolutionary forces that shape cooperation among
	parasites in order to produce a stochastic simulation model of macroparasite
	social evolution. First, we theoretically investigate a parasite

	alternative therapeutic agents, such as phages and bacteriocins against

	is governed by a 'single-hit' kinetics according to which the agent
	will kill once it is bound to its target. In addition to requiring
	only a single molecule for killing, these agents bind irreversibly
	to their targets. Here, we explore the pharmacodynamics of such 'irreversible,
	single-hit inhibitors' using mathematical models. We focus on agents
	that do not replicate, i.e. in the case of phage therapy, we deal

	restrict our analysis to replication of incompetent viruses. We study
	the impact of adsorption on dead cells, heterogeneity in adsorption

	between synonymous codons in unicellular organisms in which growth
	rate (or possibly growth yield) can be equated with fitness. Selection
	can arise from differences in either the speed or the accuracy of

  year = {2008},
  volume = {4},
  abstract = {The evolutionary potential of a gene is constrained not only by the
	amino acid sequence of its product, but by its DNA sequence as well.
	The topology of the genetic code is such that half of the amino acids
	exhibit synonymous codons that can reach different subsets of amino
	acids from each other through single mutation. Thus, synonymous DNA
	sequences should access different regions of the protein sequence
	space through a limited number of mutations, and this may deeply
	influence the evolution of natural proteins. Here, we demonstrate
	that this feature can be of value for manipulating protein evolvability.
	We designed an algorithm that, starting from an input gene, constructs
	a synonymous sequence that systematically includes the codons with
	the most different evolutionary perspectives; i.e., codons that maximize
	accessibility to amino acids previously unreachable from the template
	by point mutation. A synonymous version of a bacterial antibiotic
	resistance gene was computed and synthesized. When concurrently submitted
	to identical directed evolution protocols, both the wild type and
	the recoded sequence led to the isolation of specific, advantageous
	phenotypic variants. Simulations based on a mutation isolated only
	from the synthetic gene libraries were conducted to assess the impact
	of sub-functional selective constraints, such as codon usage, on
	natural adaptation. Our data demonstrate that rational design of
	synonymous synthetic genes stands as an affordable improvement to
	any directed evolution protocol. We show that using two synonymous
	DNA sequences improves the overall yield of the procedure by increasing
	the diversity of mutants generated. These results provide conclusive
	evidence that synonymous coding sequences do experience different
	areas of the corresponding protein adaptive landscape, and that a
	sequence's codon usage effectively constrains the evolution of the
	encoded protein.},

	a significant role in protein evolution through continuous positive

	i.e. mutations that directly affect enzymatic function, and compensatory

	Compensatory mutations are by far the most frequent of the two and

	a mechanistic basis for the examples of highly constrained evolutionary
	landscapes and parallel evolution reported in natural and experimental

	genomes represent an alternative but they are of difficult interpretation
	due to lateral gene transfer, which creates a mosaic spectrum of
	related phage species. Based on a large-scale codon bias analysis
	of 116 DNA phages hosted by 11 translationally biased bacteria belonging
	to different phylogenetic families, we observe that phage genomes
	are almost always under codon selective pressure imposed by translationally
	biased hosts, and we propose a classification of phages with translationally
	biased hosts which is based on adaptation patterns. We introduce
	a computational method for comparing phages sharing homologous proteins,

	phages, independently from the host, capsid genes appear to be the
	most affected by host translational bias. For coliphages, genes involved

	hypothesis predicts that the wobble nucleotide of {tRNA} anticodon
	should evolve toward maximizing the Watson-Crick base pairing with

	In contrast, the wobble versatility hypothesis argues that the nucleotide
	at the wobble site should be occupied by a nucleotide most versatile
	in wobble pairing, i.e., the wobble site of the {tRNA} anticodon
	should be G for NNY codon families and U for NNR and NNN codon families

	We examined codon usage and anticodon wobble sites in 36 fungal genomes

	hypothesis is generally supported, there are interesting exceptions
	involving {tRNA}(Arg) translating the CGN codon family, {tRNA}(Trp)
	translating the UGR codon family, and {tRNA}(Met) translating the

  abstract = {Objective: To develop a model to predict transmission of HIV-1 from
	men to women. Design: HIV-1 in seminal plasma, and endocervical CCR5
	receptors were correlated with epidemiological studies of HIV-1 transmission
	to develop a probabilistic model. Settings: Semen samples were collected
	from patient subjects in Seattle Washington, Chapel Hill, North Carolina,
	and St. Gallen, Switzerland. Endocervical biopsy specimens were obtained
	from women in Chicago, Illinois. Participants: Eighty-six men (not
	receiving antireroviral therapy) in whom CD4 cell count and semen
	volume were available, and 24 women in whom the number of endocervical
	CCR5 receptors were determined. Main outcome measures: Prediction
	of transmission of HIV-1 from men to women per episode of vaginal
	intercourse based on the absolute burden of HIV (volume x HIV RNA
	copies/ml seminal plasma). Results: The model suggests efficient
	heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 when semen viral burden is high.
	When semen contains 1 00 000 copies of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)
	HIV RNA the probability of HIV-1 transmission is 1 per 100 episodes
	of intercourse; conversely, with 1000 copies NSI HIV RNA in semen,
	transmission probability is 3 per 10 000 episodes of intercourse.
	Conclusions: This model links biological and epidemiological data
	related to heterosexual HIV-1 transmission. The model can be used
	to estimate transmission of HIV from men with high semen viral burden
	from inflammation, or reduced burden after antiretroviral therapy.
	The results offer a biological explanation for the magnitude of the
	HIV epidemic in places where earlier studies have shown men have
	high semen viral burden, such as in sub-Saharan Africa. The model
	can be used to develop and test HIV-1 prevention strategies. (C)

	General linear mixed models (GLMM) techniques were used to estimate

	HIV-1 RNA was observed among subjects with lower CD4 counts receiving
	therapy. Our findings confirm and extend the idea that the concentrations
	of HIV-1 in semen often differ from the HIV-1 concentration in blood.
	Antiretroviral therapy administered to subjects with low CD4 counts
	result in sufficient concomitant reduction of HIV-1 in blood and

  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Background: In mammals, contrary to what is usually assumed, recent
	evidence suggests that synonymous mutations may not be selectively
	neutral. This position has proven contentious, not least because
	of the absence of a viable mechanism. Here we test whether synonymous
	mutations might be under selection owing to their effects on the
	thermodynamic stability of {mRNA}, mediated by changes in secondary
	structure. Results: We provide numerous lines of evidence that are
	all consistent with the above hypothesis. Most notably, by simulating
	evolution and reallocating the substitutions observed in the mouse
	lineage, we show that the location of synonymous mutations is non-random
	with respect to stability. Importantly, the preference for cytosine
	at 4-fold degenerate sites, diagnostic of selection, can be explained
	by its effect on {mRNA} stability. Likewise, by interchanging synonymous
	codons, we find naturally occurring {mRNA}s to be more stable than
	simulant transcripts. Housekeeping genes, whose proteins are under
	strong purifying selection, are also under the greatest pressure
	to maintain stability. Conclusion: Taken together, our results provide
	evidence that, in mammals, synonymous sites do not evolve neutrally,
	at least in part owing to selection on {mRNA} stability. This has

	In this paper we analyse the mutational and translational stability
	of such tRNA code. Our approach is based on the model of "ambiguous
	intermediate" and on the study of underlying block structure and
	Eulerean graph technique. It is shown that the wobble rules and the
	reduced number of tRNA anticodons strongly affect the mutational
	and translational stability of the code. The selection of tRNA anticodons,
	besides the optimization of translation, also ensures the more reliable
	start and, to a lesser extent, the stop of translation. The attribution
	of tRNA anticodons to the groups {WWW, WWS, SWW, SWS} and {SSS, SSW,
	WSS, WSW} as well as {MMM, MMK, KMM, KMK} and {KKK, KKM, MKK, MKM}
	clearly correlates with class 1 and class 11 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
	and obeys the principle of the optimal coding in both cases. Both
	W-S and M-K groupings also refer to the encoding of amino acids with
	the large and small side-chain volumes, which may provide such an
	attribution. The higher variability of tRNA code agrees with the
	suggestions that the variations in an assignment of tRNA anticodons
	may serve as the driving force generating the different variants
	of the genetic code. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We explore and quantify the physical and biochemical mechanisms that may be relevant in the regulation of translation. After elongation and detachment from the 39 termination site of mRNA, parts of the ribosome machinery can diffuse back to the initiation site, especially if it is held nearby, enhancing overall translation rates. The elongation steps of the mRNA-bound ribosomes are modeled using exact and asymptotic results of the totally asymmetric exclusion process. Since the ribosome injection rates of the totally asymmetric exclusion process depend on the local concentrations at the initiation site, a source of ribosomes emanating from the termination end can feed back to the initiation site, leading to a self-consistent set of equations for the steady-state ribosome throughput. Additional mRNA binding factors can also promote loop formation, or cyclization, bringing the initiation and termination sites into close proximity. The probability distribution of the distance between the initiation and termination sites is described using simple noninteracting polymer models. We find that the initiation, or initial ribosome adsorption binding required for maximal throughput, can vary dramatically depending on certain values of the bulk ribosome concentration and diffusion constant. If cooperative interactions among the loop-promoting proteins and the initiation/termination sites are considered, the throughput can be further regulated in a nonmonotonic manner. Experiments that can potentially test the hypothesized physical mechanisms are discussed. },

	for differences in dispersal characteristics (1) among individuals
	within species, and (2) among species dispersed by the same vector.
	In general, an inverse power function best described animal-dispersed
	species and the Gaussian and Student t functions best described wind-dispersed
	species. Animal-dispersed species had longer mean dispersal distances

	form of the seed shadow between animaland wind-dispersed species,
	seed shadows varied markedly within species and vector, with conspecifics
	and species within vector varying in their dispersal scale, fecundity,
	and clumping parameters. Dispersal vectors determine a significant
	amount of variation in seed distribution, but much variation remains
	to be explained. Finally, we demonstrate that most seeds, regardless
	of vector, fall directly under the parent canopy. Long-distance dispersal
	events (>60 m) account for a small proportion of the seed crop but
	may still be important in terms of the absolute numbers of dispersed
	seeds and effects on population and community dynamics. }

	code-the code for protein production, and the code for DNA packaging
	into nucleosomes. Since these codes have to coexist simultaneously
	on the same DNA region, both must be degenerate to allow this coexistence.
	A-tracts are homopolymeric stretches of several adjacent deoxyadenosines
	on one strand of the double helix, having unusual structural properties,
	which were shown to exclude nucleosomes and as such are instrumental
	in setting the translational positioning of DNA within nucleosomes.
	We observe, cross-kingdoms, a strong codon bias toward the avoidance
	of long A-tracts in exon regions, which enables the formation of
	high density of nucleosomes in these regions. Moreover, long A-tract
	avoidance is restricted exclusively to nucleosome-occupied exon regions.
	We show that this bias in codon usage is sufficient for enabling
	DNA organization within nucleosomes without constraints on the actual
	code for proteins. Thus, there is interdependency of the two major
	codes within DNA to allow their coexistence. Furthermore, we show
	that modulation of A-tract occurrences in exon versus non-exon regions

  abstract = {Recent large-scale genomic and evolutionary studies have revealed
	the small but detectable signature of weak selection on synonymous
	mutations during mammalian evolution, likely acting at the level
	of translational efficacy (i.e., translational selection). To investigate
	whether weak selection, and translational selection in particular,
	plays any role in shaping the fate of synonymous mutations that are
	present today in human populations, we studied genetic variation
	at the polymorphic level and patterns of evolution in the human lineage
	after human-chimpanzee separation. We find evidence that neutral
	mechanisms are influencing the frequency of polymorphic mutations
	in humans. Our results suggest a recent increase in mutational tendencies
	toward AT, observed in all isochores, that is responsible for AT
	mutations segregating at lower frequencies than GC mutations. In
	all, however, changes in mutational tendencies and other neutral
	scenarios are not sufficient to explain a difference between synonymous
	and noncoding mutations or a difference between synonymous mutations
	potentially advantageous or deleterious under a translational selection
	model. Furthermore, several estimates of selection intensity on synonymous
	mutations all suggest a detectable influence of weak selection acting
	at the level of translational selection. Thus, random genetic drift,
	recent changes in mutational tendencies, and weak selection influence
	the fate of synonymous mutations that are present today as polymorphisms.
	All of these features, neutral and selective, should be taken into
	account in evolutionary analyses that often assume constancy of mutational
	tendencies and complete neutrality of synonymous mutations. },

  abstract = {Natural selection influences synonymous mutations and synonymous codon
	usage in many eukaryotes to improve the efficiency of translation
	in highly expressed genes. Recent studies of gene composition in
	eukaryotes have shown that codon usage also varies independently
	of expression levels, both among genes and at the intragenic level.
	Here, we investigate rates of evolution (Ks) and intensity of selection
	({gamma}s) on synonymous mutations in two groups of genes that differ
	greatly in the length of their exons, but with equivalent levels
	of gene expression and rates of crossing-over in Drosophila melanogaster.
	We estimate {gamma}s using patterns of divergence and polymorphism
	in 50 Drosophila genes (100 kb of coding sequence) to take into account
	possible variation in mutation trends across the genome, among genes
	or among codons. We show that genes with long exons exhibit higher
	Ks and reduced {gamma}s compared to genes with short exons. We also
	show that Ks and {gamma}s vary significantly across long exons, with
	higher Ks and reduced {gamma}s in the central region compared to
	flanking regions of the same exons, hence indicating that the difference
	between genes with short and long exons can be mostly attributed
	to the central region of these long exons. Although amino acid composition
	can also play a significant role when estimating Ks and {gamma}s,
	our analyses show that the differences in Ks and {gamma}s between
	genes with short and long exons and across long exons cannot be explained
	by differences in protein composition. All these results are consistent
	with the Interference Selection (IS) model that proposes that the
	Hill-Robertson (HR) effect caused by many weakly selected mutations
	has detectable evolutionary consequences at the intragenic level
	in genomes with recombination. Under the IS model, exon size and
	exon-intron structure influence the effectiveness of selection, with
	long exons showing reduced effectiveness of selection when compared
	to small exons and the central region of long exons showing reduced
	intensity of selection compared to flanking coding regions. Finally,
	our results further stress the need to consider selection on synonymous
	mutations and its variation--among and across genes and exons--in
	studies of protein evolution.},

  abstract = {Weakly selected mutations are most likely to be physically clustered
	across genomes and, when sufficiently linked, they alter each others'
	fixation probability, a process we call interference selection (IS).
	Here we study population genetics and evolutionary consequences of
	IS on the selected mutations themselves and on adjacent selectively
	neutral variation. We show that IS reduces levels of polymorphism
	and increases low-frequency variants and linkage disequilibrium,
	in both selected and adjacent neutral mutations. IS can account for
	several well-documented patterns of variation and composition in
	genomic regions with low rates of crossing over in Drosophila. IS
	cannot be described simply as a reduction in the efficacy of selection
	and effective population size in standard models of selection and
	drift. Rather, IS can be better understood with models that incorporate
	a constant "traffic" of competing alleles. Our simulations also allow
	us to make genome-wide predictions that are specific to IS. We show
	that IS will be more severe at sites in the center of a region containing
	weakly selected mutations than at sites located close to the edge
	of the region. Drosophila melanogaster genomic data strongly support
	this prediction, with genes without introns showing significantly
	reduced codon bias in the center of coding regions. As expected,
	if introns relieve IS, genes with centrally located introns do not
	shore reduced codon bias in the center of the coding region. We also
	show that reasonably small differences in the length of intermediate
	"neutral" sequences embedded in a region under selection increase
	the effectiveness of selection on the adjacent selected sequences.
	Hence, the presence and length of sequences such as introns or intergenic
	regions can be a trait subject to selection in recombining genomes.
	In support of this prediction, intron presence is positively correlated
	with a gene's codon bias in D. melanogaster. Finally, the study of
	temporal dynamics of IS after a change of recombination rate shows
	that nonequilibrium codon usage may be the norm rather than the exception.},

	the mechanism of toxicity of AGA codons proximal to the start codon
	or prior to the termination codon in bacteria. The codon sequences
	of the 'mini-ORFs' employed were initiator, combinations of AGA and
	CGA, and terminator. Both, AGA and CGA are low-usage Arg codons in
	ORFs of \emph{Escherichia coli} but, whilst AGA is translated by
	the scarce {tRNA}(Arg4), CGA is recognized by the abundant {tRNA}(Arg2).
	Overexpression of minigenes harbouring AGA in the third position,
	next to a termination codon, was deleterious to the cell and led
	to the accumulation of peptidyl-{tRNA}(Arg4) and of the peptidyl-{tRNA}
	cognate to the preceding CGA or AGA Arg triplet. The minigenes carrying
	CGA in the third position were not toxic. Minigene-mediated toxicity
	and peptidyl-{tRNA} accumulation were suppressed by overproduction
	of {tRNA}(Arg4) but not by overproduction of peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase,
	an enzyme that is only active on substrates that have been released
	from the ribosome. Consistent with these findings, peptidyl-{tRNA}(Arg4)
	was identified to be mainly associated with ribosomes in a stand-by
	complex. These and previous results support the hypothesis that the
	primary mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis by AGA triplets
	in pth(+) cells involves sequestration of {tRNA}s as peptidyl-{tRNA}
	on the stalled ribosome. }

	\emph{in vivo} assays show that translation of CGA is relatively
	inefficient, in the first, nine tandem CGA cause a strong rho-mediated
	polar effect on expression of a lacZ reporter gene, the inhibition
	is made more extreme by a mutation in ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL),
	which indicates that ribosomal binding by {tRNA}(ICG)(Arg) is slow

	are substituted for the regulatory UGA of the RF2 frameshift, confirms
	that aa-{tRNA} selection is slow and/or unstable at CGA. In the third
	assay, CGA is found to be a poor 5' context for amber suppression,

	with translation of a codon in the A site. Two possible errors, frameshifting
	and premature termination by RF2, are not significant causes for

	determinants during primary infection have been described, the virus-host

	were infected intrahepatically with H77-RNA (n = 3) or intravenously
	with infected serum. Blood samples were taken 1-3 times per week
	for 6 months. A new model was fitted to the observed HCV RNA and
	alanine aminotransferase (ALT) kinetics. Results: After infection,
	viral levels increased in a biphasic manner with a transient decline
	in between. This can be explained by a partial block (mean, 91\%)
	of virion production, possibly due to an endogenous type I interferon
	response. After reaching maximum levels, a long viral plateau (mean,
	6A log cp/mL) can be explained by blind homeostasis and lack of susceptible
	cells. Modest elevations in ALT levels (21-93 IU/L) were concurrently
	observed, indicating a shorter half-life of infected versus noninfected
	hepatocytes (mean ratio, 2.6). Following the ALT flare, viral titers
	rapidly declined to a lower (mean, 4.5 log cp/mL; n = 6) or undetectable
	level (n = 4). This decline is compatible with increased cell death
	(mean minimal estimate half-life, 28.7 days) and non-cytolytic clearance
	(mean maximal estimate half-life, 24.1 days) of infected cells. Conclusions:
	Our results quantify virus-host dynamics during primary HCV infection
	and suggest that endogenous type I interferon slows virus production
	in the early acute phase. Partial or effective virus control correlates
	with the half-life of infected cells regulated by both cytolytic
	and noncytolytic mechanisms.}

  abstract = {A mathematical model is presented that explores the relationship between
	transmission patterns and the evolution of virulence for horizontally
	transmitted parasites when only a single parasite strain can infect
	each host. The model is constructed by decomposing parasite transmission
	into two processes, the rate of contact between hosts and the probability
	of transmission per contact. These transmission rate components,
	as well as the total parasite mortality rate, are allowed to vary
	over the course of an infection. A general evolutionarily stable
	condition is presented that partitions the effects of virulence on
	parasite fitness into three components: fecundity benefits, mortality
	costs. and morbidity costs. This extension of previous theory allows
	us to explore the evolutionary consequences of a variety of transmission
	patterns. I then focus attention on a special case in which the parasite
	density remains approximately constant during an infection, and I
	demonstrate two important ways in which transmission modes can affect
	virulence evolution: by imposing different morbidity costs on the
	parasite and by altering the scheduling of parasite reproduction
	during an infection. Both are illustrated with examples. including
	one that examines the hypothesis that vector-borne parasites should
	be more virulent than non-vector-borne parasites (Ewald 1994). The
	validity of this hypothesis depends upon the way in which these two
	effects interact, and it need not hold in general. },

	Indeed, some data do conform to this general pattern. Nevertheless,
	his hypothesis has generated some debate about the extent to which

	of mathematical epidemiology. In particular, I present a dynamic
	optimization model for the evolution of parasite replication strategies
	that explicitly explores the validity of this hypothesis. A few different
	model assumptions are explored and it is found that Ewald's hypothesis
	has only qualified support as a general explanation for why vector-borne

	(Kalman filter) for convenient fitting to time series data. The model
	has a multivariate normal likelihood function and is simple enough
	for a variety of uses ranging from theoretical study of parameter
	estimation issues to routine data analyses in population monitoring.
	A special case of the model is the discrete-time, stochastic exponential
	growth model (density independence) with environmental-type process
	error and lognormal observation error. We describe two methods for
	estimating parameters in the Gompertz state-space model, and we compare
	the statistical qualities of the methods with computer simulations.
	The methods are maximum likelihood based on observations and restricted
	maximum likelihood based on first differences. Both offer adequate
	statistical properties. Because the likelihood function is identical
	to a repeated-measures analysis of variance model with a random time
	effect, parameter estimates can be calculated using PROC MIXED of
	SAS. We use the model to analyze a data set from the Breeding Bird
	Survey. The fitted model suggests that over 70\% of the noise in
	the population's growth rate is due to observation error. The model
	describes the autocovariance properties of the data especially well.
	While observation error and process noise variance parameters can
	both be estimated from one time series, multimodal likelihood functions
	can and do occur. For data arising from the model, the statistically
	consistent parameter estimates do not necessarily correspond to the
	global maximum in the likelihood function. Maximization, simulation,
	and bootstrapping programs must accommodate the phenomenon of multimodal
	likelihood functions to produce statistically valid results.},

  pages = {3064-3077},
  abstract = {In experimental population ecology, there is often a gap between realistic
	models used to hypothesize about population dynamics and statistical
	models used to analyze data. Ecologists routinely conduct experiments
	where the data from each replicate are short time series of estimated
	population abundances structured by stage, species, and/or other
	information, and the conventional test for treatment effects uses
	a general linear model (GLM) such as analysis of variance (ANOVA).
	However, GLMs do not incorporate demographic relationships between
	abundances through time. An alternative is to use population-dynamics
	models as frameworks for statistical hypothesis testing. This approach
	requires general methods for-fitting structured population models
	that can incorporate both process noise (stochastic dynamics) and
	observation error (inaccurate data). This paper presents such methods
	and compares them to GLMs for testing population-dynamics hypotheses
	from experiments. The methods are Monte Carlo state-space likelihood
	methods, including a basic Monte Carlo integration method and a recently
	developed Monte Carlo kernel likelihood method. Three simulated examples
	of population-dynamics experiments were used to compare analysis
	with a population model to ANOVA, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA),
	and, repeated-measures ANOVA. The examples considered manipulations
	of host-plant growth conditions, causing decreased survival and increased
	fecundity; predator addition to investigate a behaviorally mediated
	change in prey demography; and changed host-plant growth conditions
	with a more complex model for herbivore dynamics than the one used
	for analysis. For the first example, a population model gave much,
	higher statistical power than any of the ANOVA methods and provides
	greater biological insight. For the second example, ANOVA models
	are not suited to test for the behavioral effect, but a population
	model detected it with high statistical power. The third example
	suggests that even incorrect biological structure can provide better
	inferences than omitting all biological structure. The likelihood
	methods presented here make analysis with structured population models
	feasible for a wide range of models incorporating process noise and
	observation error, thus offering higher statistical power and greater
	biological insight for population-dynamics experiments. }

	of the landscape influence species persistence. Patch models that
	incorporate the spatial structure of the landscape have been used
	to investigate static habitat destruction by comparing persistence
	results within nested landscapes. Other researchers have incorporated
	temporal structure into their models by making habitat suitability
	a dynamic feature of the landscape. In this article, we present a
	spatially realistic patch model that allows patches to be in one
	of three states: uninhabitable, habitable, or occupied. The model
	is analytically tractable and allows us to explore the interactions
	between the spatial and temporal structure of the landscape as perceived
	by the target species. Extinction thresholds are derived that depend
	on habitat suitability, mean lifetime of a patch, and metapopulation
	capacity. We find that a species is able to tolerate more ephemeral
	destruction, provided that the rate of the destruction does not exceed
	the scale of its own metapopulation dynamics, which is dictated by
	natural history characteristics and the spatial structure of the
	landscape. This model allows for an expansion of the classic definition
	of a patch and should prove useful when considering species inhabiting
	complex dynamic landscapes, for example, agricultural landscapes.},

	which has euchromatic and heterochromatic members, we find that protein-coding

	heterochromatic members of the family show a reduced CG content and
	increased variation in DNA sequence. We show that the CG reduction
	applies broadly to the protein-coding sequences of genes located
	at the heterochromatin:euchromatin interface, with a very strong
	correlation between CG content and the distance from centric heterochromatin.
	We also observe a similar trend in the transition from telomeric

  abstract = {Objective To provide principles for the appropriate use of avermectin/milbemycin
	or macrocyclic lactone (ML) anthelmintics in sheep, to ensure effective
	worm control and to minimise selection for ML resistance. Strategy
	The principles were based on an assessment of the information currently
	available. The MLs were categorised into three groups (ivermectin
	[IVM], abamectin [ABA] and moxidectin [MOX]) based on structural
	differences, persistence and efficacy against ML resistant strains.
	The reported order of activity or efficacy against ML resistant worm
	strains was IVM<ABA<MOX. General treatment schemes were considered
	for Australian conditions and were divided into the following situations:
	1. quarantine treatment, 2. treatment on/to clean pasture, 3. treatment
	on/to safe pasture, 4. treatment on/to moderate/heavily contaminated
	pasture. For each of these situations a strategy was considered for
	farms where ML resistance was present or absent. It was assumed that
	resistance commonly occurs in some or all other broad spectrum anthelmintics,
	and even where ML resistance has been detected, the ML group remains
	the most effective. The guidelines provided are general and it is
	expected that state agencies and sheep/veterinary advisers would
	give specific advice to suit their environments and drug resistance/worm
	problems. Conclusions The primary recommendation is to use a mixture
	of effective drugs when treating sheep. However, unless the combination
	treatment is highly effective it is unlikely to delay selection for
	ML resistance if sheep are being treated and moved to a clean or
	safe pasture. Where possible, reliance on the ML anthelmintics should
	be reduced by not using them every year, not using them in low risk
	stock or by using narrow spectrum and low efficacy drugs such as
	naphthalophos when appropriate. Anthelmintic treatment should be
	given as part of a strategic worm control program. It is suggested
	that IVM-oral and IVM-capsules should not be used when ML resistance
	is present. In this situation MOX or ABA should be used in combination
	with other drugs, provided that the chosen MIL is effective against
	the resistant parasite. It is essential to monitor the efficacy of
	ML and drug combinations by post-treatment worm egg counts, particularly
	when ML resistance has been detected. }

	polymorphisms (InDels) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs).
	While inbreeding depression and heterosis imply that a substantial

	from neutral polymorphism remains a significant challenge. To identify
	deleterious and neutral DNA sequence variation within Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae, we sequenced the genome of a vineyard and oak tree strain
	and compared them to a reference genome. Among these three strains,
	6\% of the genome is variable, mostly attributable to variation in
	genome content that results from large InDels. Out of the 88,000
	polymorphisms identified, 93\% are SNPs and a small but significant
	fraction can be attributed to recent interspecific introgression
	and ectopic gene conversion. In comparison to the reference genome,
	there is substantial evidence for functional variation in gene content
	and structure that results from large InDels, frame-shifts, and polymorphic
	start and stop codons. Comparison of polymorphism to divergence reveals
	scant evidence for positive selection but an abundance of evidence

  abstract = {Natural selection on codon usage is a pervasive force that acts on
	a large variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Despite this,
	obtaining reliable estimates of selection on codon usage has proved
	complicated, perhaps due to the fact that the selection coefficients
	involved are very small. In this work, a population genetics model
	is used to measure the strength of selected codon usage bias, S,
	in 10 eukaryotic genomes. It is shown that the strength of selection
	is closely linked to expression and that reliable estimates of selection
	coefficients can only be obtained for genes with very similar expression
	levels. We compare the strength of selected codon usage for orthologous
	genes across all 10 genomes classified according to expression categories.
	Fungi genomes present the largest S values (2.24-2.56), whereas multicellular
	invertebrate and plant genomes present more moderate values (0.61-1.91).
	The large mammalian genomes (human and mouse) show low S values (0.22-0.51)
	for the most highly expressed genes. This might not be evidence for
	selection in these organisms as the technique used here to estimate
	S does not properly account for nucleotide composition heterogeneity
	along such genomes. The relationship between estimated S values and

  abstract = {Robustness seems to be the opposite of evolvability. If phenotypes
	are robust against mutation, we might expect that a population will
	have difficulty adapting to an environmental change, as several studies
	have suggested. However, other studies contend that robust organisms
	are more adaptable. A quantitative understanding of the relationship
	between robustness and evolvability will help resolve these conflicting
	reports and will clarify outstanding problems in molecular and experimental
	evolution, evolutionary developmental biology and protein engineering.
	Here we demonstrate, using a general population genetics model, that
	mutational robustness can either impede or facilitate adaptation,
	depending on the population size, the mutation rate and the structure
	of the fitness landscape. In particular, neutral diversity in a robust
	population can accelerate adaptation as long as the number of phenotypes
	accessible to an individual by mutation is smaller than the total
	number of phenotypes in the fitness landscape. These results provide
	a quantitative resolution to a significant ambiguity in evolutionary
	theory.},

  abstract = { in theory, parasites can create time-lagged, frequenc dependent selection
	in their hosts, resulting in oscillatory gene-frequency dynamics
	in both the host and the parasite (the Red Queen hypothesis). However,
	oscillatory dynamics have not been observed in natural populations.
	In the present study, we evaluated the dynamics of asexual clones
	of a New Zealand snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, and its trematode
	parasites over a five-year period. During the summer of each year,
	we determined host-clone frequencies in random samples of the snail
	to track genetic changes in the snail population. Similarly, we monitored
	changes in the parasite population, focusing on the dominant parasite,
	Microphallus sp., by calculating the frequency of clones in samples
	of infected individuals from the same collections. We then compared
	these results to the results of a computer model that was designed
	to examine clone frequency dynamics for various levels of parasite
	virulence. Consistent with these simulations and with ideas regarding
	dynamic coevolution, parasites responded to common clones in a time-lagged
	fashion. Finally, in a laboratory experiment, we found that crones
	that had been rare during the previous five years were significantly
	less infectible by Microphallus when compared to the common clones.
	Taken together, these results confirm that rare host genotypes are
	more likely to escape infection by parasites; they also show that
	host-parasite interactions produce, in a natural population, some
	of the dynamics anticipated by the Red Queen hypothesis. },

	Pressures proportional to {mRNA} level slow evolutionary rates of

	rate variation within a~domain is much less correlated to protein
	abundance. Distinct pressures may be associated primarily with the

  abstract = {Genes in the MHC have been associated with mate choice and odor preferences
	in a variety of animals. Although the role of HLA genes in human
	mate choice has been controversial, studies in the Hutterites have
	demonstrated fewer than expected numbers of couples who match for
	an HLA haplotype, suggesting that in this population there is avoidance
	of mates with HLA haplotypes similar to one's own haplotype. Recently,
	18 olfactory receptor (OR) genes have been mapped to the HLA region,
	telomeric to the HLA-F locus, providing a potential mechanism for
	HLA-based odor recognition and perhaps mate preferences in humans.
	We screened a sample of Hutterites with diverse HLA haplotypes for
	polymorphisms in the HLA-linked olfactory receptor gene, FAT11, by
	sequencing, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, and
	allele-specific oligo dot-blotting. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms
	were detected in the single translated exon of this gene, all of
	which resulted in amino acid substitutions (Phe587Leu, Ala642Val,
	and Thr1157Ala). The FAT11 Phe587-Val642-Ala1157 allele occurred
	on 17 different HLA haplotypes, the Leu587-Ala642-Ala1157 allele

	four alleles of the FAT11 gene are present in the Hutterites. This

	residual effects if a model of the demography is available. We apply
	the method to extensively sampled single-nucleotide polymorphism

	coli genes than elsewhere. The rate of synonymous substitution between
	E.coli and Salmonella typhimurium is substantially reduced near the

	pressure which competes with the selection for codons which are most
	rapidly translated. Possible competing sources of selection are the
	presence of secondary ribosome binding sites downstream from the
	start codon, the avoidance of {mRNA} secondary structure near the
	start of the gene and the use of sub-optimal codons to regulate gene
	expression. We provide evidence against the last of these possibilities.
	We also show that there is a decrease in the frequency of A, and
	an increase in the frequency of G along the E. coli genes at all

	between \emph{Escherichia coli} and Salmonella typhimurium is lower
	in highly than in weakly expressed genes, and it has been suggested
	that this is due to stronger selection for translational efficiency
	in highly expressed genes as reflected in their greater codon usage
	bias. This hypothesis is tested here by comparing the substitution
	rate in codon families with different patterns of synonymous codon
	use. It is shown that the decline in the substitution rate across
	expression levels is as great for codon families that do nor appear
	to be subject to selection for translational efficiency as for those
	that are. This implies that selection on translational efficiency
	is not responsible for the decline in the substitution rate across

	is a decrease in the mutation rate. It is also shown that a simple

	and processivity errors, since processivity errors now appear to
	result from a second error occurring after recruitment of an errant
	aminoacyl-tRNA, either spontaneous dissociation causing premature
	termination or translational frameshifting, This is dearest in programmed
	translational frameshifting where the mRNA programs errant reading

	error (a dual-error model of frameshifting). The same mechanism can
	explain frameshifting by suppressor tRNAs, even those with expanded

	for all of them. We suggest that the 'spontaneous' tRNA-induced frameshifting

	although the frequency of frameshifting is very different. This new

	these fermentations. We have surveyed DNA sequence diversity at five

  pages = {1-19},
  abstract = {Malaria has long been a scourge to humans. The exceptionally high
	mortality in some regions has led to strong selection for resistance,
	even at the cost of increased risk of potentially fatal red blood
	cell deformities in some offspring. In particular, genes that confers
	resistance to malaria when they appear in heterozygous individuals
	are known to lead to sickle-cell anemia, or other blood diseases,
	when they appear in homozygous form. Thus, there is balancing selection
	against the evolution of resistance, with the strength of that selection
	dependent upon malaria prevalence. Over longer time scales, the increased
	frequency of resistance in a population might be expected to decrease
	the frequency of malaria and reduce selection for resistance. However,
	possession of the sickle-cell gene leads to longer-lasting parasitaemia
	in heterozygote individuals, and therefore the presence of resistance
	may actually increase infection prevalence. In this paper, we explore
	the interplay among these processes, operating over very different
	time scales. In particular, we show that on the fast time scale of
	malarial dynamics, the disease level reaches an equilibrium; on the
	slower, evolutionary time scale, this equilibrium tracks gene frequency.
	We analyze the slow time scale dynamics to investigate the impact
	of malaria on the evolution of resistance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	We report such an approach, focusing on the particularly well-documented
	case of measles. We propose the use of a discrete time epidemic model
	comprising the infected and susceptible class as state variables.
	The model uses a discrete time version of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered
	type epidemic models, which can be fitted to observed disease incidence
	time series. We describe a method for reconstructing the dynamics
	of the susceptible class, which is an unobserved state variable of
	the dynamical system. The model provides a remarkable fit to the
	data on case reports of measles in England and Wales from 1944 to
	1964. Morever, its systematic part explains the well-documented predominant
	biennial cyclic pattern. We study the dynamic behaviour of the time
	series model and show that episodes of annual cyclicity, which have
	not previously been explained quantitatively, arise as a response
	to a quicker replenishment of the susceptible class during the baby
	boom, around 1947. },

  abstract = {Aging or senescence is an age-dependent decline in physiological function,

	by natural selection. So why do organisms age and die? In the 1940s
	and 1950s evolutionary geneticists resolved this paradox by positing
	that aging evolves because selection is inefficient at maintaining
	function late in life. By the 1980s and 1990s this evolutionary theory
	of aging had received firm empirical support, but little was known
	about the mechanisms of aging. Around the same time biologists began
	to apply the tools of molecular genetics to aging and successfully
	identified mutations that affect longevity. Today. the molecular
	genetics of aging is a burgeoning field, but progress in evolutionary
	genetics of aging has largely stalled. Here we argue that some of
	the most exciting and unresolved questions about aging require an
	integration of molecular and evolutionary approaches. Is aging a
	universal process? Why do species age at different rates? Are the
	mechanisms of aging conserved or lineage-specific? Are longevity
	genes identified in the laboratory under selection in natural populations?
	What is the genetic basis of plasticity in aging in response to environmental
	cues and is this plasticity adaptive? What are the mechanisms underlying
	trade-offs between early fitness traits and life span? To answer
	these questions evolutionary biologists must adopt the tools of molecular
	biology, while molecular biologists must put their experiments into
	an evolutionary framework. The time is ripe for a synthesis of molecular

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that the translation rate depends on the
	availability of cognate aa-tRNAs. In this study it is shown that
	the key factor that determines translation rate is the competition
	between near-cognate and cognate aa-tRNAs. The transport mechanism
	in the cytoplasm is diffusion, thus the competition between cognate,
	near-cognate and non-cognate aa-tRNAs to bind to the ribosome is
	a stochastic process. Two competition measures are introduced; C(i)
	and R(i) (i=1, 64) are quotients of the arrival frequencies of near-cognates
	vs. cognates and non-cognates vs. cognates, respectively. Furthermore,
	the reaction rates of bound cognates differ from those of bound near-cognates.
	If a near-cognate aa-tRNA binds to the A site of the ribosome, it
	may be rejected at the anti-codon recognition step or proofreading
	step or it may be accepted. Regardless of its fate, the near-cognates
	and non-cognates have caused delays of varying duration to the observed
	rate of translation. Rate constants have been measured at a temperature
	of 20 degrees C by (Gromadski, K.B., Rodnina, M.V., 2004. Kinetic
	determinants of high-fidelity tRNA discrimination on the ribosome.
	Mol. Cell 13, 191-200). These rate constants have been re-evaluated
	at 37 degrees C, using experimental data at 24.5 degrees C and 37
	degrees C (Varenne, S., et al., 1984. Translation in a non-uniform
	process: effect of tRNA availability on the rate of elongation of
	nascent polypeptide chains. J. Mol. Biol. 180, 549-576). The key
	results of the study are: (i) the average time (at 37 degrees C)
	to add an amino acid, as defined by the ith codon, to the nascent
	peptide chain is: tau(i)=9.06+1.445x[10.48C(i)+0.5R(i)] (in ms);
	(ii) the misreading frequency is directly proportional to the near-cognate
	competition, E(i)=0.0009C(i); (iii) the competition from near-cognates,
	and not the availability of cognate aa-tRNAs, is the most important
	factor that determines the translation rate - the four codons with
	highest near-cognate competition (in the case of E. coli) are [GCC]>[CGG]>[AGG]>[GGA],
	which overlap only partially with the rarest codons: [AGG]<[CCA]<[GCC]<[CAC];
	(iv) based on the kinetic rates at 37 degrees C, the average time
	to insert a cognate amino acid is 9.06ms and the average delay to
	process a near-cognate aa-tRNA is 10.45ms and (vii) the model also
	provides estimates of the vacancy times of the A site of the ribosome
	- an important factor in frameshifting.},

  abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly
	coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent
	to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution
	of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates
	within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations,
	while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model
	further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire
	a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members
	of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the
	old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion
	of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model.
	Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the
	evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum.
	Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show
	how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory
	elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both
	duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution
	of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation
	(DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory
	elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate
	gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation
	is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution
	of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis
	of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent
	with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental
	approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene
	subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to
	be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates.
	For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of
	the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous
	regulatory mutation.Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an
	advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable,
	function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial
	protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional
	mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively,
	a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a
	pseudogene.Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if mutations
	create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted
	to occur rarely.Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus overall, with
	complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene
	duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression
	sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity
	for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development
	itself.Cooke et al. 1997 (p. 362)},

  abstract = {A general framework is presented to unify diverse models of natural
	selection. This framework is based on the Price Equation, with two
	additional steps. First, characters are described by their multiple
	regression on a set of predictor variables. The most common predictors
	in genetics are alleles and their interactions, but any predictor
	may be used. The second step is to describe fitness by multiple regression
	on characters. Once again, characters may be chosen arbitrarily.
	This expanded Price Equation provides an exact description of total
	evolutionary change under all conditions, and for all systems of
	inheritance and selection. The model is first used for a new proof
	of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. The relations
	are then made clear among Fisher's theorem, Robertson's covariance
	theorem for quantitative genetics, the Lande-Arnold model for the
	causal analysis of natural selection, and Hamilton's rule for kin
	selection. Each of these models is a partial analysis of total evolutionary
	change. The Price Equation extends each model to an exact, total
	analysis of evolutionary change for any system of inheritance and

  abstract = {Genomes of some parasites contain dozens of alternative and highly
	diverged surface antigens, of which only a single one is expressed
	in any cell. Individual cells occasionally change expression of their
	surface antigen, allowing them to escape immune surveillance. These
	switches appear to occur in a partly random way, creating a diverse
	set of antigenic variants. In spite of this diversity, the parasitemia
	develops as a series of outbreaks, in which each outbreak is dominated
	by relatively few antigenic types. Host-specific immunity eventually
	clears the dominant antigenic types, and a new Outbreak follows from
	antigenic types that have apparently been present all along at low
	frequency. This pattern of sequential dominance by different antigenic
	types remains unexplained. We review the five most prominent theories,
	which have developed mainly from studies of the protozoans Trypanosoma
	and Plasmodium, and the bacterial spirochete Borrelia. The most promising
	theories depend on some combination of mechanisms to create favored
	connectivity pathways through the matrix of transitions between variants.
	Favored pathways may arise from biased switches at the molecular
	level of gene expression or front biases imposed by immune selection.
	We illustrate the concept of connectivity pathways by reanalysis
	of data on transitions between variants from Borrelia hermsii. (c)

	but also between patients, especially during the asymptomatic stage

	to correlate with both decreased time to AIDS and increased infectiousness.
	The aim of this study is to characterize the epidemiological impact
	of heterogeneity in set-point viral load. By analyzing two cohorts
	of untreated patients, we quantify the relationships between both
	viral load and infectiousness and the duration of the asymptomatic
	infectious period. We find that, because both the duration of infection
	and infectiousness determine the opportunities for the virus to be
	transmitted, this suggests a trade-off between these contributions
	to the overall transmission potential. Some public health implications
	of variation in set-point viral load are discussed. We observe that
	set-point viral loads are clustered around those that maximize the
	transmission potential, and this leads us to hypothesize that HIV-1
	could have evolved to optimize its transmissibility, a form of adaptation
	to the human host population. We discuss how this evolutionary hypothesis
	can be tested, review the evidence available to date, and highlight

  abstract = {All organisms have elaborate mechanisms to control rates of protein
	production. However, protein production is also subject to stochastic
	fluctuations, or "noise." Several recent studies in Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae and \emph{Escherichia coli} have investigated the relationship
	between transcription and translation rates and stochastic fluctuations
	in protein levels, or more generally, how such randomness is a function

	of whether stochasticity in protein expression is generally biologically
	relevant has not been addressed, and it remains unknown whether random

	cerevisiae, we estimate the noise in protein production for nearly
	every yeast gene, and confirm our prediction that the production
	of essential and complex-forming proteins involves lower levels of

	escape, potentially overcoming limited vaccine protection. Although
	transmission of immune escape variants has been reported, the overall
	extent to which this phenomenon occurs in populations and the degree
	to which it contributes to HIV-1 viral evolution are unknown. Selection
	on the HIV-1 env gene at transmission favors neutralization-sensitive

	internal HIV-1 proteins to restrict or enhance the transmission of
	immune escape variants. Studies have suggested that HLA class I may

	no evidence of selection acting to restrict transmission of HIV-1

	alleles are not present in acute infection, suggesting that the majority
	of viral polymorphisms in these patients are the result of transmission
	rather than de novo adaptation. Using four episodes of HIV-1 transmission
	in which the donors and recipients were both sampled very close to
	the time of infection we found that, despite a transmission bottleneck,
	genetic variants of HIV-1 infection are transmitted in a frequency-dependent
	manner. As HIV-1 infections are seeded by unique donor-adapted viral
	variants, each episode is a highly individual antigenic challenge.
	Host-specific, idiosyncratic HIV-1 antigenic diversity will seriously

	the impact of BD and amino acid usage on estimates of Nc. It is shown
	that both factors have a significant effect on accuracy and precision.
	Both amino acid usage and BID influence accuracy considerably, especially
	in short genes. Finally, I demonstrate how the definition of bias
	discrepancy can be applied to investigate if codon usage is influenced

  abstract = {Why do parasites harm their hosts? the general understanding is that
	if the transmission rate and virulence of a parasite are linked,
	then the parasite must harm its host to maximize its transmission.
	The exact nature of such trade-offs remains largely unclear, but
	for vertebrate hosts it probably involves interactions between a
	microparasite and the host immune system. Previous results have suggested
	that in a homogeneous host population in the absence of superor coinfection,
	within-host dynamics lead to selection of the parasite with an intermediate
	growth rate that is just being controlled by the immune system before
	it kills the host (Antia et al. 1994). In this paper, we examine
	how this result changes when heterogeneity is introduced to the host
	population. We incorporate the simplest form of heterogeneity-random
	heterogeneity in the parameters describing the size of the initial
	parasite inoculum. the immune response of the host, and the lethal
	density at which the parasite kills the host. We find that the general
	conclusion of the previous model holds: parasites evolve some intermediate
	growth rate. However, in contrast with the generally accepted view.
	we find that virulence (measured by the case mortality or the rate
	of parasite-induced host mortality) increases with heterogeneity.
	Finally, we link the within-host and between-host dynamics of parasites.
	We show how the parameters for epidemiological spread of the disease
	can be estimated from the within-host dynamics, and in doing so examine
	the way in which trade-offs between these epidemiological parameters
	arise as a consequence of the interaction of the parasite and the
	immune response of the host. }

	hypothesis) posits that large brains and distinctive cognitive abilities
	of humans have evolved via intense social competition in which social
	competitors developed increasingly sophisticated "Machiavellian"
	strategies as a means to achieve higher social and reproductive success.
	Here we build a mathematical model aiming to explore this hypothesis.
	In the model, genes control brains which invent and learn strategies
	(memes) which are used by males to gain advantage in competition
	for mates. We show that the dynamics of intelligence has three distinct
	phases. During the dormant phase only newly invented memes are present
	in the population. During the cognitive explosion phase the population's
	meme count and the learning ability, cerebral capacity (controlling
	the number of different memes that the brain can learn and use),
	and Machiavellian fitness of individuals increase in a runaway fashion.
	During the saturation phase natural selection resulting from the
	costs of having large brains checks further increases in cognitive
	abilities. Overall, our results suggest that the mechanisms underlying
	the "Machiavellian intelligence" hypothesis can indeed result in
	the evolution of significant cognitive abilities on the time scale
	of 10 to 20 thousand generations. We show that cerebral capacity
	evolves faster and to a larger degree than learning ability. Our
	model suggests that there may be a tendency toward a reduction in
	cognitive abilities (driven by the costs of having a large brain)
	as the reproductive advantage of having a large brain decreases and
	the exposure to memes increases in modern societies.},

  abstract = {The gravitational evolution of the cosmic one-point probability distribution
	function (PDF) has been estimated using an analytic approximation
	that combines gravitational perturbation theory with the Edgeworth
	expansion around a Gaussian PDF. Despite the remarkable success of
	the Edgeworth expansion in modeling the weakly nonlinear growth of
	fluctuations around the peak of the cosmic PDF, it fails to reproduce
	the expected behavior in the tails of the distribution. This expansion
	is also ill defined, since it predicts negative densities and negative
	probabilities for the cosmic fields. This is a natural consequence
	of using an expansion around the Gaussian distribution, which is
	not rigorously well defined when describing a positive variate such
	as the density held. Here we present an alternative to the Edgeworth
	series based on an expansion around the gamma PDF. The gamma expansion
	is designed to converge when the PDF exhibits exponential tails,
	which are predicted by perturbation theory in the weakly nonlinear
	regime, and are found in numerical simulations from Gaussian initial
	conditions. The proposed expansion is better suited to describing
	a real PDF, since it always yields positive densities and the PDF
	is effectively positive-definite. We compare the performance of the
	Edgeworth and the gamma expansions for a wide dynamic range, making
	use of cosmological N-body simulations and assessing their range
	of validity. In general, the gamma expansion provides an interesting
	and simple alternative to the Edgeworth series, and it should be
	useful for modeling non-Gaussian PDFs in other contexts, such as
	in the cosmic microwave background. },

	We explore the properties of dominance relationships in a simple
	developmental system consisting of a diffusion-gradient-threshold
	mechanism commonly deployed in pattern formation. We show that a
	single nonlinear process (diffusion) within this integrated mechanism
	leads to the emergence of dominance in all components of the mechanism.
	Unlike the situation in metabolic pathways, where new mutations are
	most likely to be recessive, the structure of the nonlinearities
	in this developmental mechanism is such that in certain circumstances
	new mutations are equally likely to be dominant or recessive. Although
	the dominance we observe in this system is the result of a physiological
	process, we also find that dominance can evolve by microevolutionary
	mechanisms and thus are able to reconcile the opposing views of Fisher
	and Wright on dominance.},

	coevolution using a nested modeling approach. The first step in this
	approach is to construct a mechanistic model of the parasite population
	dynamics within a host. The second step is to define an epidemiological
	model which is used to derive the fitness functions for both the
	host and the parasite. The within-host model is then nested within
	the epidemiological model by linking the epidemiological parameters
	such as the transmission rate of the infection or the additional
	host mortality rate to the dynamics of the within-host model. Nesting
	the within host model into an epidemiological model allows us to
	evaluate the fitness functions for each interactor which in turn
	allows us to determine the coevolutionary dynamics of the system.
	This nested approach has the advantage over other approaches in that
	mechanistic descriptions of the host-parasite biology are used to
	derive, rather than impose, life-history trade-offs. We illustrate
	this framework by analysing a simple host-parasite system. In this
	particular system we find that the coevolutionary equilibrium is
	always stable and that host survivorship and parasite fitness vary
	greatly with the cost of the immune response and parasite growth.

	infected. Draws on Kermack and McKendrick 1927 to calculate the fraction
	of the population affected by the infection $I$ which satisfies the
	equation, $I = 1 - \exp[I n \beta \gamma]$ where $\gamma$ is the
	sum of the added mortality and recovery rates. Shows that whether
	or not the resistance allele will be favored is a function of the
	ratio of the cost of resistance to the cost of infection and the
	expected number of affected host's (i.e. $I$). A number of interesting
	findings, one of which is that if the cost of resistance is small
	then the evolutionary equilib. density of susceptibles will be just
	below that of the threshold density of susceptibles. He generalizes
	this model to a diploid form and finds no changes in behavior. Discussion:
	"The difference equation (1) shows that selection for resistance
	to epidemics is both a frequency and density dependent form of selection."
	Because of this freq. dependence, the equilibrium allele freq. does
	not coincide with the freq. that maximizes mean fitness. "We are
	thus faced with yet another example of where the Fundamental Theorem
	of Natrual Selection does not hold for a biologically important situation."
	in some sense, it seems like Antonovics and Thrall (1994) and Boots
	and Haraguchi are just extensions of this. In fact, Antonovics and
	Thrall note:"Gillespie(1975), in one of the first papers to integrate

	and somatic investments. However, empirical studies have shown that
	intraspecific phenotypic correlations between these two resource
	investments are often positive or nonsignificant, rather than negative
	as predicted. The model of Van Noordwijk and De Jong (1986) was proposed
	to explain these unexpected results. According to their model, positive
	correlations between reproductive and somatic investments will result
	if individual variation in resource acquisition exceeds that of resource
	allocation, whereas negative correlations will result if individual
	variation in resource allocation exceeds that of resource acquisition.
	To test this model, I used body storage/condition as an index of
	somatic investment because it is usually strongly related to level
	of resource acquisition. I predicted that laboratory studies should
	more often show negative correlations between reproductive and somatic
	investments than field studies, because individual variation in resource
	acquisition is expected to be lower in controlled laboratory environments
	than in variable natural environments. A literature review revealed
	that correlations between somatic (storage) investment and reproductive
	investment (estimated as clutch/litter mass, number of offspring
	per clutch/litter, or number of clutches/litters) among conspecific
	breeding female animals are more often positive (15 species) or nonsignificant
	(17 species) than negative (6 species). Moreover, as expected, five
	of six negative correlations were observed in laboratory studies,
	whereas 13 of 15 positive correlations were observed in field studies.
	It is concluded that future empirical and theoretical work on life
	histories should consider individual variation in both resource acquisition
	and allocation and the interaction between the two. }

  abstract = {The aim of the present paper is to study the evolutionary dynamics
	of selfish replicators in a constant genetic background. Selfish
	replicators are viewed as alleles at a single locus, having a pleiotropic
	effect. Infinitely many alleles are possible; they act on individual
	fitness and have various levels of ability to distort segregation.
	This results in a two-level process of selection, including inter-individual
	selection (effect on individual fitness) and intra-individual selection
	(ability to distort segregation). The model takes other parameters
	into account, such as dominance, inbreeding and inbreeding depression.
	The system can have two different behaviours. (1) In some cases,
	evolutionary cycles are possible. The cycles correspond to an alternation
	of phases with predominant inter-individual selection, corresponding
	to major-effect mutations, and phases with predominant intra-individual
	selection, corresponding to small-effect mutations. (2) For other
	values of the parameters, a synthetic fitness can be defined: this
	absolute allelic fitness is estimated as a function of one's fitness
	due to both inter-individual and intra-individual selection. During
	the course of evolution, the synthetic fitness increases. The optimisation
	of a synthetic fitness is the most general process. The optimised
	value is essentially homologous to the value optimised for resource
	allocation to male and female function in hermaphrodites (female
	function being homologous to the effect on individual fitness, and
	male function being homologous to distortion ability). The relative
	importance of both behaviours is discussed. It is argued that repeated
	sequences causing some human degenerative hereditary diseases may
	follow a two-step evolutionary process: a progressive increase in
	number of sequences accompanied by a decrease of the individual fitness
	would be followed by massive elimination of such sequences. But in
	general the optimisation of the synthetic fitness seems to be more
	likely.},

	Species $y$ fitness, however, is only of function of species $x$

	different amounts of gene flow and under both soft selection (local
	regulation of density within a patch, independent of selection) and
	hard selection (proportion of adults emerging from a spot is a function
	of selection and total population regulation occurs globally). Assume
	positive freq. dependent selection, i.e. fitness of an allele increases
	or decreases linearly with frequency of the allele of the other species.
	Isolated spots: no gene flow from h to c or c to h. Five possible
	equilibria. Four corner and one internal which is always unstable.
	The stability of the corners depends on the sign of the interaction.
	Hot spots: If the interaction is antagonistic then "mismatched alleles"
	are stable. If the interaction is cooperative then matche alleles
	become fixed. Victim-exploiter is unstable, but eventually becomes
	fixed arbitrarily for finite systems. Uniform mixing: Variation in
	habitats, but gene frequency across entire system is looked at since
	there is uniform mixing (i.e. prob. of offspring going to hot or
	cold spot is independent of origin and is simply proportional to
	fraction of habitat which is hot or cold). Hard Selection: okay.
	there's really nothing that profound in all of this. There are, however,
	some cool graphs (check out Fig 7).}

  abstract = {The human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) is encoded by exons 2-10
	of the hGHR gene on chromosome 5p13.1-p12. There are several different
	5' Untranslated region (5'UTR) variants of hGHR {mRNA} that all encode
	the same protein. We have recently mapped the V1-V9 5'UTR sequences
	within 40kb of the 5' flanking region of the hGHR gene. Seven of
	the exons are clustered within two small modules, module A (V2-V9-V3)
	and module B (V7-V1-V4-V8), similar to 38 kb and similar to 18 kb
	respectively upstream of exon 2 of the coding region; V6 lies midway
	between the two modules and V5 is adjacent to exon 2. We now report
	the existence of two subvariant V3 exons, one upstream of module
	A (exon V3b) and one midway between module B and exon 2 (exon V3a/b).
	Both have sequences homologous to Alu elements. In addition, we determined
	the alternative splicing mechanisms that produce three different
	{mRNA}s from these exons: V3c (from the V3 exon in module A) or V3a
	and V3b (from a combination of exon V3 and the Alu-containing V3
	subvariant exons). hGHR expression is under developmentaland tissue-specific
	regulation: module A-derived {mRNA}s are widely expressed in human
	tissues, while module B-derived {mRNA}s are only detectable in postnatal
	liver. Expression of the variant V3 {mRNA}s is similar to those from
	module A, being produced ubiquitously in human fetal and postnatal
	tissues, with V3c always the major variant detected. The Alu-containing
	{mRNA}s (V3a and V3b) are also detectable in baboon and rhesus tissues,
	in accordance with the finding of Alu elements throughout the primate
	genome. In summary, we have mapped the relative locations of two
	new 5'UTR exons within the 5' flanking region of the hGHR gene and
	described the derivation and expression patterns for two variant
	hGHR {mRNA}s from these primate-specific exons. The introduction

  volume = {217},
  pages = {351-368},
  abstract = {We aimed to provide a theoretical framework for dynamic studies of
	competition between fungi living on divided and ephemeral resources.
	We previously adapted the seminal Skellam's patch-occupancy model
	(Skellam, 1951) to describe the population dynamics of one species
	of unit-restricted fungus whose mycelial growth occurs within resource
	units and which colonizes new resource units by spore dispersal (Gourbiere
	et al., 1999). In this study, we extended this model to describe
	the competition between a pair of unit-restricted fungal species
	that interact. with each other inside units by decreasing their spore
	production. Accordingly, we designed a discrete-time metapopulation
	model where all patches go extinct at each generation and species
	interact by lowering their propagule production in jointly occupied
	patches. We showed that the two species easily coexist although there
	is no trade-off between their competitive and colonization abilities.
	Furthermore, the outcome of the competition process can depend on
	a founder effect. Founder effect determines either which species
	is excluded or the relative densities of each species when they coexist.
	We investigated the implications of these results on the distribution
	and abundance of fungal species along environmental gradients. This
	work bridges the gap between the mycological theory of "Resource
	Units" and the metapopulation theory, showing the specificity of
	fungal exploitation competition. We suggest that unit-restricted
	fungal species are appropriate biological models to test the theoretical
	results of the metapopulation theory, such as the appearance of alternative
	stable equilibria. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}

	fit could not be obtained; therefore, robust estimates of sequestered
	parasite dynamics remained unavailable. We conclude that even given
	detailed data on individual parasitaemia, estimates of sequestered
	numbers may be difficult to obtain. However, if data on individuals
	undergoing similar therapy are collected at equal time intervals,
	some of these problems may be overcome by estimating specific parameters

	ends from different chromosomes become associated, followed by ''pseudo-excision,''
	We show that two different processes are in involved in resolving
	the pseudo-excision event: (1) the excised P-element ends continue
	to function as a single unit (Hybrid Element) and insert at a nearby
	site in the chromosome or into the element itself [Hybrid Element
	Insertion (HEI)] and (2) free ends that do not contain Pelements
	repair and rejoin [(Hybrid Excision and Repair (HER)]. Both types
	of resolution can lead to recombination, and this paper concentrates
	on the HEI class. One type of HEI event predicts the exact reverse
	complementary duplication of an 8-bp target site, and we have confirmed
	the existence of such a structure in six independently derived recombinant
	chromosomes. There is also a high tendency for insertion events to
	occur within a few bases of the original 8-bp target site, including

  journal = {Ecological Monographs},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {72},
  pages = {185-202},
  abstract = {Two key linked questions in Population dynamics are the relative importance
	of noise vs. density-dependent nonlinearities and the limits on temporal
	predictability of population abundance. We propose that childhood
	microparasitic infections, notably measles. provide an unusually
	suitable empirical and theoretical test bed for addressing these
	issues. We base our analysis on a new mechanistic time series model
	for measles, the TSIR model. which captures the mechanistic essence
	of epidemic dynamics. The model, and parameter estimates based on
	short-term fits to prevaccination measles time series for 60 towns
	and cities in England and Wales, is introduced in a companion paper.
	Here. we explore how well the model predicts the long-term dynamics
	of measles and the balance between noise and determinism, as a function
	of population size. The TSIR model captures the basic dynamical features
	of the long-term pattern of measles epidemics in large cities remarkably
	well (based on time and frequency domain analyses). In particular,
	the model illustrates the impact of secular increases in birth rates,
	which cause a transition from biennial to annual dynamics. The model
	also captures the observed increase in epidemic irregularity with
	decreasing population size and the onset of local extinction below
	a critical community size. Decreased host population size is shown
	to be associated with an increased impact of demographic stochasticity.
	The interaction between nonlinearity and noise is explored using
	local Lyapunov exponents (LLE). These testify to the high level of
	stability of the biennial attractor in large cities. Irregularities
	are due to the limit cycle evolving with changing human birth rates
	and not due to complex dynamics. The geometry of the dynamics (sign
	and magnitude of the LLEs across phase space) is similar in the cities
	and the smaller urban areas. The qualitative difference in dynamics
	between small and large host communities is that demographic and
	extinction-recolonization stochasticities are much more influential
	in the former. The regional dynamics can therefore only be understood
	in terms of a core-satellite metapopulation structure for this host-enemy
	system. We also make a preliminary exploration of the model's ability
	to predict the dynamic consequences of measles vaccination.},

	a powerful tool for quantifying the impact of environmental variations

	the sizes of the two populations are remarkably synchronized over
	a 40-year period, A nonlinear time-series model shows that a high

	this level of synchrony. The model indicates that if there were less
	environmental correlation, population dynamics would be much less
	synchronous than is observed. This is because of a threshold effect
	that is dependent on population size; the threshold magnifies random
	differences between populations. A refined model shows that part

  pages = {813-817},
  abstract = {Motivation: Transposon-derived Alu repeats are exclusively associated
	with primate genomes. They have gained considerable importance in
	the recent times with evidence of their involvement in various aspects
	of gene regulation, e.g. alternative splicing, nucleosome positioning,
	CpG methylation, binding sites for transcription factors and hormone
	receptors, etc. The objective of this study is to investigate the
	factors that influence the distribution of Alu repeat elements in
	the human genome. Such analysis is expected to yield insights into
	various aspects of gene regulation in primates. Results: Analysis
	of Alu repeat distribution for the human genome build 32 (released
	in January 2003) reveals that they occupy nearly one-tenth portion
	of the sequenced regions. Huge variations in Alu frequencies were
	seen across the genome with chromosome 19 being the most and chromosome
	Y being the least Alu dense chromosomes. The highlights of the analysis
	are as follows: (1) three-fourth of the total genes in the genome
	are associated with Alus. (2) Alu density is higher in genes as compared
	with intergenic regions in all the chromosomes except 19 and 22.
	(3) Alu density in human genome is highly correlated with GC content,
	gene density and intron density with GC content being major deterministic
	factor compared with other two. (4) Alu densities were correlated

	Our results are as follows. First, between the human and mouse, we
	have elaborated the among-tissue covariation between tissue expression
	distance (E(ti)) and tissue sequence distance (D(ti)). This highly
	significant E(ti) - D(ti) correlation emerges when the expression

	the observed significant correlation between the tissue expression
	distance (between the human and mouse) and the duplicate tissue distance
	(T(dup)) between human (or mouse) paralogous genes. In other words,
	between-duplicate and interspecies expression divergences covary
	among tissues. Third, for genes with the same expression broadness,
	we found that genes expressed in more stringent tissues (e.g., neurorelated)
	generally tend to evolve more slowly than those in more relaxed tissues

	owing to two mechanisms of compensation(4-10). The first is the existence
	of duplicate genes: that is, the loss of function in one copy can
	be compensated by the other copy or copies. The second mechanism
	of compensation stems from alternative metabolic pathways, regulatory
	networks, and so on. The relative importance of the two mechanisms
	has not been investigated except for a limited study, which suggested
	that the role of duplicate genes in compensation is negligible(10).
	The availability of fitness data for a nearly complete set of single-gene-deletion
	mutants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome(11) has enabled us
	to carry out a genome-wide evaluation of the role of duplicate genes
	in genetic robustness against null mutations. Here we show that there
	is a significantly higher probability of functional compensation
	for a duplicate gene than for a singleton, a high correlation between
	the frequency of compensation and the sequence similarity of two
	duplicates, and a higher probability of a severe fitness effect when
	the duplicate copy that is more highly expressed is deleted. We estimate
	that in S. cerevisiae at least a quarter of those gene deletions

	We define this probability as the "x factor." Here, we develop a
	broadly applicable approach to calculate x factors and demonstrate
	this method using the human DNA repair enzyme 3-methyladenine DNA
	glycosylase (AAG). Three gene-wide mutagenesis libraries were created,
	each with 105 diversity and averaging 2.2, 4.6, and 6.2 random amino
	acid changes per mutant. After determining the percentage of functional
	mutants in each library using high-stringency selection (>19,000-fold),
	the x factor was found to be 34\% +/- 6\%. Remarkably, reanalysis
	of data from studies of diverse proteins reveals similar inactivation
	probabilities. To delineate the nature of tolerated amino acid substitutions,
	we sequenced 244 surviving AAG mutants. The 920 tolerated substitutions
	were characterized by substitutability index and mapped onto the
	AAG primary, secondary, and known tertiary structures. Evolutionarily
	conserved residues show low substitutability indices. In AAG, 0 strands
	are on average less substitutable than alpha helices; and surface

	Our results are relevant to such diverse topics as applied molecular
	evolution, the rate of introduction of deleterious alleles into genomes

	intermediate states are deleterious. However, empirical data suggest
	that compensatory evolution is common at all levels of molecular
	interaction. A general solution to this paradox is provided by plausible
	neutral or nearly neutral intermediates that possess informational
	redundancy. These intermediates provide an evolutionary path between
	coadapted allelic combinations. Although they allow incompatible
	end points to evolve, at no point was a deleterious mutation ever
	in need of compensation. As a result, what appears to be compensatory
	evolution may often actually be "pseudocompensatory." Both theoretical
	and empirical studies indicate that pseudocompensation can speed
	the evolution of intergenic incompatibility, especially when driven
	by adaptation. However, under strong stabilizing selection the rate
	of pseudocompensatory evolution is still significant. Important examples
	of this process at work discussed here include the evolution of rRNA
	secondary structures, intraand inter-protein interactions, and developmental

  abstract = {Determining the evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance
	of gene duplicates is key to understanding the processes leading
	to evolutionary adaptation and novelty. In his highly prescient book,
	Susumu Ohno recognized that duplicate genes are fixed and maintained
	within a population with 3 distinct outcomes: neofunctionalization,
	subfunctionalization, and conservation of function. Subsequent researchers
	have proposed a multitude of population genetic models that lead
	to these outcomes, each differing largely in the role played by adaptive
	natural selection. In this paper, I present a nonmathematical review
	of these models, their predictions, and the evidence collected in
	support of each of them. Though the various outcomes of gene duplication
	are often strictly associated with the presence or absence of adaptive
	natural selection, I argue that determining the outcome of duplication
	is orthogonal to determining whether natural selection has acted.
	Despite an ever-growing field of research into the fate of gene duplicates,
	there is not yet clear evidence for the preponderance of one outcome
	over the others, much less evidence for the importance of adaptive
	or nonadaptive forces in maintaining these duplicates.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim is to review findings related to the use
	of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, focusing on its limitations
	and benefits in controlling tuberculosis (TB). Some new TB vaccines,
	which have entered or are expected to enter clinical trials, are
	highlighted. RECENT FINDINGS: BCG is currently the only available
	vaccine against TB, and is widely administered within the World Health
	Organization Expanded Programme for Immunization. Several trials
	have shown that the protective efficacy of BCG varies between different
	populations. Recently, a 60-year follow-up study of American Indians
	reported the long-term efficacy of BCG to be 52\%. The reasons for
	the low efficacy of the BCG vaccine may be generic differences in
	the BCG strains, differences in immunological properties of study
	populations or exposure to environmental factors such as mycobacteria.
	The low efficacy of the BCG vaccine has encouraged the search for
	a new vaccine. Among new vaccine candidates are live attenuated Mycobacterium
	tuberculosis vaccines, recombinant BCG, DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines
	and fusion proteins with novel adjuvants and delivery systems. SUMMARY:
	Today, most of the world's population is vaccinated with BCG. It
	is generally accepted that BCG protects against childhood TB but
	this immunity wanes with age, resulting in no or insufficient protection
	against TB. Using modern techniques, several research groups have
	developed more than 200 new vaccine candidates. Some of these vaccines
	are now in clinical trials. The clinical evaluation of these new
	vaccines should be designed to cover a heterogeneous population with
	great variation in immune responses.},

	study the ESS virulence and transmission rate of a parasite in a
	lattice-structured host population, in which the host can send progeny
	only to its neighboring vacant site, and the transmission occurs
	only in between the infected and the susceptible in the nearest-neighbor
	sites. Infected host is assumed to be infertile. the analysis based
	on the pair approximation and the Monte Carlo simulation reveal that
	the ESS transmission rate and virulence in a lattice-structured population
	are greatly reduced from those in completely mixing population. Unlike
	completely mixing populations, the spread of parasite can drive the
	host to extinction, because the local density of the susceptible
	next to the infected can remain high even when the global density
	of host becomes very low. This demographic viscosity and group selection
	between self-organized spatial clusters of host individuals then
	leads to an intermediate ESS transmission rate even if there is no
	tradeoff between transmission rate and virulence. the ESS transmission
	rate is below the region of parasite-driven extinction by a finite
	amount for moderately large reproductive rate of host; whereas, the
	evolution of transmission rate leads to the fade out of parasite
	for small reproductive rate, and the extinction of host for very
	large reproductive rate. (C) 2000 Academic Press. }

  abstract = {The patterns of nonrandom usage of synonymous codons (codon bias)
	in enteric bacteria were analyzed. Poisson random field (PRF) theory
	was used to derive the expected distribution of frequencies of nucleotides
	differing from the ancestral state at aligned sites in a set of DNA
	sequences. This distribution was applied to synonymous nucleotide
	polymorphisms and amino acid polymorphisms in the gnd and putP genes
	of \emph{Escherichia coli}. For the gnd gene, the average intensity
	of selection against disfavored synonymous codons was estimated as
	approximately 7.3 X 10(-9); this value is significantly smaller than
	the estimated selection intensity against selectively disfavored
	amino acids in observed polymorphisms (2.0 X 10(-8)), but it is approximately
	of the same order of magnitude. The selection coefficients for optimal
	synonymous codons estimated from PRF theory were consistent with
	independent estimates based on codon usage for threonine and glycine.
	Across 118 genes in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the distribution
	of estimated selection coefficients, expressed as multiples of the
	effective population size, has a mean and standard deviation of 0.5
	+/- 0.4. No significant differences were found in the degree of codon
	bias between conserved positions and replacement positions, suggesting
	that translational misincorporation is not an important selective
	constraint among synonymous polymorphic codons in enteric bacteria.
	However, across the first 100 codons of the genes, conserved amino
	acids with identical codons have significantly greater codon bias
	than that of either synonymous or nonidentical codons, suggesting
	that there are unique selective constraints, perhaps including {mRNA}
	secondary structures, in this part of the coding region.}

	family have been analyzed for three dipteran species-Drosophila melanogaster,
	Bactrocera dorsalis, and Ceratitis capitata. In certain phylogenetic
	tree reconstructions, using synonymous distances, some gene relationships
	are altered due to a homogenization phenomenon. We present evidence
	to show that this homogenization phenomenon is due to codon usage
	bias. A survey of the pattern of synonymous codon preferences for
	11 actin genes from these three species reveals that five out of
	the six Drosophila actin genes show high degrees of codon bias as
	indicated by scaled chi(2) values. In contrast to this, four out
	of the five actin genes from the other species have low codon bias
	values. A Monte Carlo contingency test indicates that for those Drosophila
	actin genes which exhibit codon bias, the patterns of codon usage
	are different compared to actin genes from the other species. In
	addition, the genes exhibiting codon bias also appear to have reduced
	rates of synonymous substitution. The homogenization phenomenon seen
	in terms of synonymous substitutions is not observed for nonsynonymous
	changes. Because of this homogenization phenomenon, ''trees'' constructed
	based on synonymous substitutions will be affected. These effects
	can be overt in the case of multigene families, but similar distortions
	may underlie reconstructions based on single-copy genes which exhibit

	In rapidly multiplying organisms, the time spent in translation is
	a limiting factor in cell division; hence, it pays to duplicate {tRNA}
	genes, thereby increasing the concentration of {tRNA} molecules in
	the cell and speeding up translation. In slowly multiplying organisms,
	translation time is not a limiting factor, so the overall translational
	cost is minimized by reducing the {tRNA}s to only one copy of each

	ideas on apparent competition (also called ''competition for enemy-free
	space'') and sketch illustrative examples. One puzzling aspect of
	this indirect interaction is the repeated rediscovery of the essential
	ideas. Apparent competition arises between focal and alternative
	prey populations because, in the long term, enemy abundance depends
	on total prey availability; by increasing enemy numbers, alternative
	prey intensify predation on focal prey. A frequent empirical finding,

	depends on particular conditions. To understand fully the consequences

	the time-scale of the interactions (short-and long-term consequences
	of sharing enemies generally differ), the structure of the food-web
	encompassing the interactions, its spatial context, etc. The ''core

	that genes from different genomes can be separated with a high degree

	address the problem of recent horizontal gene transfer, and how imported

	biases. By concentrating on the thirdand succeeding first position
	nucleotides, we eliminate most spurious contributions from codon
	usage and amino-acid requirements, focusing mainly on mutational
	effects. Since imported genes are expected to converge only gradually

	present in only one of two closely related organisms has been imported
	into one organism or deleted in the other. Striking correlations
	between the proposed distance measure and poor homology are observed
	when \emph{Escherichia coli} genes are compared to Salmonella typhi,

	functions and complex regulatory processes by studying organisms
	on a global scale; however, a major challenge lies in the voluminous,

	are needed for integration, mining, comparative analysis, and functional
	interpretation of high-throughput proteomic data. In the first part
	of this review, we discuss aspects of data integration important
	for capturing all data relevant to functional analysis. We provide
	a list of databases commonly used in genomics and proteomics and
	explain strategies to connect the source data, with especial emphasis
	on our ID mapping service. Next, we describe iProClass, a central
	data infrastructure that supports both data integration and functional
	annotation of proteins, and give a brief introduction to the data
	search/retrieval and analysis tools currently available at our website
	(http://pir.georgetown.edu) that researchers can use for large-scale

  pages = {6799-6810},
  abstract = {In a wide range of genomes, it was observed that the usage of synonymous
	codons is biased toward specific codons and codon patterns. Factors
	that are implicated in the selection for codon usage include facilitation
	of fast and accurate translation. There are two types of translational
	errors: missense errors and processivity errors. There is considerable
	evidence in support of the hypothesis that codon usage is optimized
	to minimize missense errors. In contrast, little is known about the
	relationship between codon usage and frameshifting errors, an important
	form of processivity errors, which appear to occur at frequencies
	comparable to the frequencies of missense errors. Based on the recently
	proposed pause-and-slip model of frameshifting, we developed Frameshifting
	Robustness Score (FRS). We used this measure to test if the pattern
	of codon usage indicates optimization against frameshifting errors.
	We found that the FRS values of protein-coding sequences from four
	analyzed genomes (the bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia
	coli, and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyce
	pombe) were typically higher than expected by chance. Other properties
	of FRS patterns observed in B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe,
	such as the tendency of FRS to increase from the 5'- to 3'-end of
	protein-coding sequences, were also consistent with the hypothesis
	of optimization against frameshifting errors in translation. For
	E. coli, the results of different tests were less consistent, suggestive
	of a much weaker optimization, if any. Collectively, the results
	fit the concept of selection against mistranslation-induced protein
	misfolding being one of the factors shaping the evolution of both
	coding and non-coding sequences.},

	In some of these methods, the nonsynonymous rate of substitution
	is allowed to vary across the sequence, permitting the identification
	of single amino acid positions that are under positive natural selection.
	However, it is unclear which probability distribution should be used
	to describe how the nonsynonymous rate of substitution varies across

	nonsynonymous rate across the sequence as a mixture of several discrete

	little population genetics theory to inform us of the appropriate
	probability distribution for among-site variation in the nonsynonymous

	in the nonsynonymous rate of substitution by using a Dirichlet process

	infinite number of nonsynonymous rate classes and is very flexible
	in accommodating different potential distributions for the nonsynonymous

	method, using DNA microarrays for genome-wide systematic analysis
	of {mRNA} lengths. We used this method to measure {mRNA}s corresponding
	to 84\% of the annotated open reading frames (ORFs) in the S. cerevisiae
	genome, with high precision and accuracy ( measurement errors +/-
	67\%). We found a close linear relationship between {mRNA} lengths
	and the lengths of known or predicted translated sequences; {mRNA}s
	were typically around 300 nucleotides longer than the translated
	sequences. Analysis of genes deviating from that relationship identified
	ORFs with annotation errors, ORFs that appear not to be bona fide
	genes, and potentially novel genes. Interestingly, we found that
	systematic differences in the total length of the untranslated sequences
	in {mRNA}s were related to the functions of the encoded proteins.
	Conclusions: The Virtual Northern method provides a practical and
	efficient method for genome-scale analysis of transcript lengths.
	Approximately 12-15\% of the yeast genome is represented in untranslated
	sequences of {mRNA}s. A systematic relationship between the lengths
	of the untranslated regions in yeast {mRNA}s and the functions of
	the proteins they encode may point to an important regulatory role
	for these sequences. }

	for Expression and Sequence-based Cluster Extraction (COALESCE) system
	for regulatory module prediction. The algorithm is efficient enough

	vivax. We genotyped nine tandem repeat loci bearing 2-8 bp motifs
	from 345 P. vivax infections collected from three Asian countries
	and from five locations in Colombia. We observed 9-37 alleles per
	locus and high diversity (H-e = 0.72-0.79, mean = 0.75) in all countries.
	Numbers of multiple clone infections varied considerably: these were

	one or two of the nine loci show >1 allele in many samples, suggesting

  abstract = {Background: Knowledge about the abundance of molecular components
	is an important prerequisite for building quantitative predictive
	models of cellular behavior. Proteins are central components of these
	models, since they carry out most of the fundamental processes in
	the cell. Thus far, protein concentrations have been difficult to
	measure on a large scale, but proteomic technologies have now advanced
	to a stage where this information becomes readily accessible. Results:
	Here, we describe an experimental scheme to maximize the coverage
	of proteins identified by mass spectrometry of a complex biological
	sample. Using a combination of LC-MS/MS approaches with protein and
	peptide fractionation steps we identified 1103 proteins from the
	cytosolic fraction of the \emph{Escherichia coli} strain MC4100.
	A measure of abundance is presented for each of the identified proteins,
	based on the recently developed emPAI approach which takes into account
	the number of sequenced peptides per protein. The values of abundance
	are within a broad range and accurately reflect independently measured
	copy numbers per cell. As expected, the most abundant proteins were
	those involved in protein synthesis, most notably ribosomal proteins.
	Proteins involved in energy metabolism as well as those with binding
	function were also found in high copy number while proteins annotated
	with the terms metabolism, transcription, transport, and cellular
	organization were rare. The barrel-sandwich fold was found to be
	the structural fold with the highest abundance. Highly abundant proteins
	are predicted to be less prone to aggregation based on their length,
	pI values, and occurrence patterns of hydrophobic stretches. We also
	find that abundant proteins tend to be predominantly essential. Additionally
	we observe a significant correlation between protein and {mRNA} abundance
	in E. coli cells. Conclusion: Abundance measurements for more than
	1000 E. coli proteins presented in this work represent the most complete
	study of protein abundance in a bacterial cell so far. We show significant
	associations between the abundance of a protein and its properties
	and functions in the cell. In this way, we provide both data and

	balance is assessed. Secondly, the growth schedule over multiple
	seasons is examined, and the reproductive effort, the leaf phenology
	of deciduous perennials, and the conditions under which perenniality
	is more advantageous than annuality are considered. With some modifications,
	the same model can handle intermittent reproduction and monocarpic
	perennials (one large reproduction after many years). Thirdly, growth
	in an unpredictably fluctuating environment is analysed for the case
	in which a sudden disturbance (herbivory or fire) removes the photosynthetic
	system altogether, followed by recovery using stored material, and
	for the case in which environmental productivity fluctuates in a
	Markovian process. Finally, the optimal level of chemical defence
	against herbivory is formalized and used to explain the intensity

	{mRNA}s(1). Splicing is guided locally by short conserved sequences,
	but genes typically contain many potential splice sites, and the
	mechanisms specifying the correct sites remain poorly understood.
	In most organisms, short introns recognized by the intron definition
	mechanism(2) cannot be efficiently predicted solely on the basis
	of sequence motifs(3). In multicellular eukaryotes, long introns
	are recognized through exon definition(2) and most genes produce
	multiple {mRNA} variants through alternative splicing(4). The nonsense-
	mediated {mRNA} decay(5,6) ( NMD) pathway may further shape the observed
	sets of variants by selectively degrading those containing premature
	termination codons, which are frequently produced in mammals(7,8).
	Here we show that the tiny introns of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia
	are under strong selective pressure to cause premature termination
	of {mRNA} translation in the event of intron retention, and that
	the same bias is observed among the short introns of plants, fungi
	and animals. By knocking down the two P. tetraurelia genes encoding
	UPF1, a protein that is crucial in NMD, we show that the intrinsic
	efficiency of splicing varies widely among introns and that NMD activity
	can significantly reduce the fraction of unspliced {mRNA}s. The results
	suggest that, independently of alternative splicing, species with
	large intron numbers universally rely on NMD to compensate for suboptimal

	gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This method allowed the measurement
	of the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of 29 different plasma proteins

  abstract = {We analyzed 10 genome expression data sets by large-scale cross-referencing
	against broad structural and functional categories. The data sets,
	generated by different techniques (e.g. SAGE and gene chips), provide
	various representations of the yeast transcriptome (the set of all
	yeast genes, weighted by transcript abundance). Our analysis enabled
	us to determine features more prevalent in the transcriptome than
	the genome: i.e. those that are common to highly expressed proteins.
	Starting with simplest categories, we find that, relative to the
	genome, the transcriptome is enriched in Ala and Gly and depleted
	in Asn and very long proteins. We find, furthermore, that protein
	length and maximum expression level have a roughly inverse relationship.
	To relate expression level and protein structure, we assigned transmembrane
	helices and known folds (using PSI-blast) to each protein in the
	genome; this allowed us to determine that the transcriptome is enriched
	in mixed alpha-beta structures and depleted in membrane proteins
	relative to the genome. In particular, some enzymatic folds, such
	as the TIM barrel and the G3P dehydrogenase fold, are much more prevalent
	in the transcriptome than the genome, whereas others, such as the
	protein-kinase and leucine-zipper folds, are depleted. The TIM barrel,
	in fact, is overwhelmingly the 'top fold' in the transcriptome, while
	it only ranks fifth in the genome. The most highly enriched functional
	categories in the transcriptome (based on the MIPS system) are energy
	production and protein synthesis, while categories such as transcription,
	transport and signaling ave depleted. Furthermore, for a given functional
	category, transcriptome enrichment varies quite substantially between
	the different expression data sets, with a variation an order of
	magnitude larger than for the other categories cross-referenced (e.g.
	amino acids). One can readily see how the enrichment and depletion
	of the various functional categories relates directly to that of
	particular folds. Further information can be found at http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/genome/expression.},

  abstract = {Highly expressed genes in many bacteria and small eukaryotes often
	have a strong compositional bias, in terms of codon usage. Two widely
	used numerical indices, the codon adaptation index (CAI) and the
	codon usage, use this bias to predict the expression level of genes.
	When these indices were first introduced, they were based on fairly
	simple assumptions about which genes are most highly expressed: the
	CAI was originally based on the codon composition of a set of only
	24 highly expressed genes, and the codon usage on assumptions about
	which functional classes of genes are highly expressed in fast-growing
	bacteria. Given the recent advent of genome-wide expression data,
	we should be able to improve on these assumptions. Here, we measure,
	in yeast, the degree to which consideration of the current genome-wide
	expression data sets improves the performance of both numerical indices.
	Indeed, we find that by changing the parameterization of each model
	its correlation with actual expression levels can be somewhat improved,
	although both indices are fairly insensitive to the exact way they
	are parameterized. This insensitivity indicates a consistent codon
	bias amongst highly expressed genes. We also attempt direct linear
	regression of codon composition against genome-wide expression levels
	(and protein abundance data). This has some similarity with the CAI
	formalism and yields an alternative model for the prediction of expression
	levels based on the coding sequences of genes. More information is

  abstract = {Background: Locomotion is an integral component of most animal behaviors,
	and many human health problems are associated with locomotor deficits.
	Locomotor behavior is a complex trait, with population variation
	attributable to many interacting loci with small effects that are
	sensitive to environmental conditions. However, the genetic basis
	of this complex behavior is largely uncharacterized. Results: We
	quantified locomotor behavior of Drosophila melanogaster in a large
	population of inbred lines derived from a single natural population,
	and derived replicated selection lines with different levels of locomotion.
	Estimates of broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities were 0.52
	and 0.16, respectively, indicating substantial non-additive genetic
	variance for locomotor behavior. We used whole genome expression
	analysis to identify 1,790 probe sets with different expression levels
	between the selection lines when pooled across replicates, at a false
	discovery rate of 0.001. The transcriptional responses to selection
	for locomotor, aggressive and mating behavior from the same base
	population were highly overlapping, but the magnitude of the expression
	differences between selection lines for increased and decreased levels
	of behavior was uncorrelated. We assessed the locomotor behavior
	of ten mutations in candidate genes with altered transcript abundance
	between selection lines, and identified seven novel genes affecting
	this trait. Conclusion: Expression profiling of genetically divergent
	lines is an effective strategy for identifying genes affecting complex
	behaviors, and reveals that a large number of pleiotropic genes exhibit
	correlated transcriptional responses to multiple behaviors. },

	another. Notably, the sets of regulatory motifs that controlled the
	paralogs with the most efficient backup activity deliberately overlapped

	have biased patterns of codon usage which have been observed in a
	wide range of unicellular organisms. In S. pombe and C elegans, codons
	contributing positively to the principal component with the largest

	a central pail of much of contemporary evolutionary biology; the

	detail in graduate-level treatments, and are used extensively in
	papers published in the major journals in the field. The appeal of
	visualizing the process of evolution in terms of the movement of
	populations oil such landscapes is very strong; as one becomes familiar
	with the metaphor, one often develops the feeling that it is possible
	to gain deep insights into evolution by thinking about the movement
	of populations on landscapes consisting of adaptive valleys and peaks.
	But, since Wright first introduced the metaphor in 1932, the metaphor
	has been the subject of persistent confusion, from equivocation over
	just what the features of the landscape are meant to represent to
	how we ought to expect the landscapes to look. Recent advances-conceptual,
	empirical, and computational-have pointed towards the inadequacy
	and indeed incoherence of the landscapes as usually pictured. I argue
	that attempts to reform the metaphor are misguided; it is time to
	give up the pictorial metaphor of the landscape entirely and rely

	context, and global and local G+C content. We offer a new perspective
	and new methods for elucidating codon choices applied especially
	to the human genome. We present data supporting the thesis that codon
	choices for human genes are largely a consequence of two factors:
	(1) amino acid constraints, (2) maintaining DNA structures dependent
	on base-step conformational tendencies consistent with the organism's
	genome signature that is determined by genome-wide processes of DNA
	modification, replication and repair. The related codon signature
	defined as the dinucleotide relative abundances at the distinct codon
	positions {1, 2}, {2, 3}, and {3, 4} (4 = 1 of the next codon) accommodates
	both the global genome signature and amino acid constraints. In human
	genes, codon positions {2, 3} and {3, 4} containing the silent site
	have similar codon signatures reflecting DNA symmetry. Strong CG
	and TA dinucleotide underrepresentation is observed at all codon
	positions as well as in non-coding regions. Estimates of synonymous
	codon usage based on codon signatures are in excellent agreement
	with the actual codon usage in human and general vertebrate genes.
	These properties are largely independent of the isochore compartment
	(G + C content),gene size, and transcriptional and translational
	constraints. We hypothesize that major influences on codon usage
	in human genes result from residue preferences and diresidue associations
	in proteins coupled to biases on the DNA level, related to replication

	RPs in archaea and eukaryotes compared with that in bacteria may
	reflect a more complex set of interactions in archaea and eukaryotes
	in regulating translation, e.g., differences in structure requiring
	scaffolding of longer rRNA molecules, expanded interactions with
	the chaperone machinery, and, in eukaryotic interactions with endoplasmic
	reticulum components. The yeast genome is similar to fast-growing
	bacteria in PHX genes but also features several cytoskeletal genes,
	including actin and tropomyosin, and several signal transduction
	regulatory proteins from the 14.3.3 family. The most PHX genes of
	Drosophila encode cytoskeletal and exoskeletal proteins. We found
	that the preference of a microorganism for an anaerobic metabolism
	correlates with the number of PHX enzymes of the glycolysis pathway
	that well exceeds the number of PHX enzymes acting in the tricarboxylic
	acid cycle. Conversely, if the number of PHX enzymes of the tricarboxylic
	acid cycle well exceeds the PHX enzymes of glycolysis, an aerobic
	metabolism is preferred. Where the numbers are approximately commensurate,
	a facultative growth behavior prevails.}

	if its codon usage is rather similar to the average codon usage of
	at least one of the RP, transcription/translation factors, and chaperone
	gene classes and deviates strongly from the average gene of the genome.
	The thermosome (Ths) chaperonin family represents the most salient
	PHX genes among Archaea. The chaperones Trigger factor and HSP70
	have overlapping functions in the folding process, but both of these
	proteins are lacking in most archaea where they may be substituted
	by the chaperone prefoldin. Other distinctive PHX proteins of Archaea,
	absent from Bacteria, include the proliferating cell nuclear antigen
	PCNA, a replication auxiliary factor responsible for tethering the
	catalytic unit of DNA polymerase to DNA during highspeed replication,
	and the acidic RP P-0, which helps to initiate {mRNA} translation
	at the ribosome. Other PHX genes feature Cell division control protein
	48 (Cdc48), whereas the bacterial septation proteins FtsZ and minD
	are lacking in Crenarchaea. RadA is a major DNA repair and recombination
	protein of Archaea. Archaeal genomes feature a strong Shine-Dalgarno

  abstract = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied
	populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative
	importance of various potential causes of the cycles, Over the past
	three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number
	of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population
	models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques
	both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models
	to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced
	that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these
	complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches.
	In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem
	of population cycles, using both long-term population time series
	and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology
	of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical
	models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles.
	Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate
	even qualitatively appropriate dynamics, We finish quantifying the
	remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent
	experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using
	modern statistical techniques, Finally, we compare simulated time
	series generated by the models to the observed time series, using
	a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively
	as "probes." The model most similar to the data, as measured by these
	probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent
	the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this
	approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in
	which we know the "true" governing mechanism. Our analysis, which
	uses only a subset of the information available about the population,
	uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach
	might be successfully applied to field populations as well. }

	the threshold density with regard to some dominant contagious disease."

	where fresh animals were introduced at a constant rate into the cages
	in which cases of disease were already present\ldots" "an attempt
	has also been made to include partial immunity which may follow an
	attack." Again they start with the case of constant parameters, but
	then do an analysis using arbitrary general functions. Additional
	analyses of five special cases are presented in part III. Assume
	only one disease and that its the only source of mortality. Model:
	Constant-- Define model, do a stability analysis about equilibrium
	and show that they are generally stable, potentially oscillatory.
	They then explore five special cases (no imm. , no births, disease
	fatal, etc). Results are summarized in Table I Variable rates: allow
	recovery, added mort, etc to vary with age of an infection. Results
	are summarized in Table II. Discussion:In general the find that there
	can be at most one steady state. If these open populations exceed
	the threshold, then a certain proportion will become sick, but that
	number will not be as large as the total amount the population exceeds
	the threshold (why? I don't know) although the disease rate (i.e.
	the rate of disease spread?) will be proportional to the excess when
	the excess is small. Equilibriums can be stable or unstable, but
	are generally stable in the cases with constant rates.}

	1 (Paip1) is another factor that interacts with PABP to coactivate
	translation. Here, we describe a novel human PABP-interacting protein
	(Paip2), which acts as a repressor of translation both \emph{in vitro}
	and \emph{in vivo}. Paip2 preferentially inhibits translation of
	a poly(A)-containing {mRNA}, but has no effect on the translation
	of hepatitis C virus {mRNA}, which is capand eIf4G-independent. Paip2
	decreases the affinity of PABP for polyadenylate RNA, and disrupts
	the repeating structure of poly(A) ribonucleoprotein. Furthermore,
	Paip2 competes with Paip1 for PABP binding. Thus, Paip2 inhibits
	translation by interdicting PABP function. }

	a wide range of animals and threatens human health by contaminating
	food and water. A markedly limited number of clonal parasite lineages
	have been recognized as predominating in North American and European
	populations, whereas strains from South America are comparatively
	diverse. Here, we show that strains from North America and Europe
	share distinct genetic polymorphisms that are mutually exclusive
	from polymorphisms in strains from the south. A striking exception
	to this geographic segregation is a monomorphic version of one chromosome
	(Chr1a) that characterizes virtually all northern and many southern
	isolates. Using a combination of molecular phylogenetic and phenotypic
	analyses, we conclude that northern and southern parasite populations
	diverged from a common ancestor in isolation over a period of approximately
	10(6) yr, and that the monomorphic Chr1a has swept each population
	within the past 10,000 years. Like its definitive feline hosts, T.
	gondii may have entered South America and diversified there after
	reestablishment of the Panamanian land bridge. Since then, recombination
	has been an infrequent but important force in generating new T. gondii
	genotypes. Genes unique to a monomorphic version of a single parasite
	chromosome may have facilitated a recent population sweep of a limited
	number of highly successful T. gondii lineages.},

	has been a call for creating Biology Concept Inventories, multiple-choice
	exams that test important biology concepts, analogous to those in
	physics, astronomy, and chemistry. We argue that the community of
	researchers and educators must first reach consensus about not only
	what concepts are important to test, but also how the concepts should
	be organized and how that organization might influence teaching and

	the efficacy of these strategies, we have carefully monitored student
	performance and have demonstrated a large gain in a pre- and posttest

  year = {2002},

  pages = {1-34},
  abstract = {Selection of the translational initiation site in most eukaryotic
	{mRNA}s appears to occur via a scanning mechanism which predicts
	that proximity to the 5' end plays a dominant role in identifying
	the start codon. This 'position effect' is seen in cases where a
	mutation creates an AUG codon upstream from the normal start site
	and translation shifts to the upstream site. The position effect
	is evident also in cases where a silent internal AUG codon is activated
	upon being relocated closer to the 5' end. Two mechanisms for escaping
	the first-AUG rule - reinitiation and context-dependent leaky scanning
	- enable downstream AUG codons to be accessed in some {mRNA}s. Although
	these mechanisms are not new, many new examples of their use have
	emerged. Via these escape pathways, the scanning mechanism operates
	even in extreme cases, such as a plant virus {mRNA} in which translation
	initiates from three start sites over a distance of 900 nt. This
	depends on careful structural arrangements, however, which are rarely
	present in cellular {mRNA}s. Understanding the rules for initiation
	of translation enables understanding of human diseases in which the
	expression of a critical gene is reduced by mutations that add upstream
	AUG codons or change the context around the AUG START codon. The
	opposite problem occurs in the case of hereditary thrombocythemia:
	translational efficiency is increased by mutations that remove or
	restructure a small upstream open reading frame in thrombopoietin
	{mRNA}, and the resulting overproduction of the cytokine causes the
	disease. This and other examples support the idea that 5' leader
	sequences are sometimes structured deliberately in a way that constrains
	scanning in order to prevent harmful overproduction of potent regulatory
	proteins. The accumulated evidence reveals how the scanning mechanism
	dictates the pattern of transcription - forcing production of monocistronic
	{mRNA}s - and the pattern of translation of eukaryotic cellular and
	viral genes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

  abstract = {Optimal allocation of energy to growth and reproduction was studied
	with a dynamic optimization method for long-lived animals inhabiting
	a seasonal environment. We found that, after maturation, it is optimal
	to grow either over several years (if the animals age in the sense
	that their mortality increases with age) or asymptotically (if there
	is no ageing). Asymptotic growth can be well approximated with Bertalanffy's
	equation, even if the animals are able to grow to infinity. This
	is because it is optimal to allocate an increasing proportion of
	surplus energy to reproduction year after year following maturation.
	Age at first reproduction depends on mortality in both favourable
	and unfavourable seasons, and also depends on the favourable season
	length - it is optimal to mature early when mortality is high in
	either season or the season is short. Size at maturity depends additionally
	on the parameters of the equation describing the size-dependence
	of the production rate. When mortality in the unfavourable season
	is high compared to mortality in the favourable season, a large part
	of growth is realized after maturation. The model qualitatively explains
	growth patterns and life histories in fish, reptiles, amphibians
	and some long-lived invertebrates which grow after maturation. To
	understand better the diversity of life histories, held biologists
	working on such animals should focus on differences in the ageing
	rate, favourable season length, mortality rates in both seasons and
	the size-dependence of production rate. Optimization models based
	on the allocation principle are promising tools to integrate these
	kinds of data.}

	differences in rates among the errors tested or in sensitivity of
	the reporter systems. To develop a more accurate understanding of
	the range of error rates, we developed a system to quantify the frequency
	of every possible misreading error at a defined codon in Escherichia
	coli. This system uses an essential lysine in the active site of
	firefly luciferase. Mutations in Lys529 result in up to a 1600-fold
	reduction in activity, but the phenotype varies with amino acid.
	We hypothesized that residual activity of some of the mutant genes
	might result from misreading of the mutant codons by {tRNA}(UUU)(Lys),
	the cognate {tRNA} for the lysine codons, AAA and AAG. Our data validate
	this hypothesis and reveal details about relative missense error
	rates of near-cognate codons. The error rates in E. coli do, in fact,
	vary widely. One source of variation is the effect of competition
	by cognate {tRNA}s for the mutant codons; higher error frequencies
	result from lower competition from low-abundance {tRNA}s. We also
	used the system to study the effect of ribosomal protein mutations
	known to affect error rates and the effect of error-inducing antibiotics,
	finding that they affect misreading on only a subset of near-cognate
	codons and that their effect may be less general than previously

  abstract = {In \emph{Escherichia coli}, uridine in the wobble position of {tRNA}(Glu)

	believed to restrict the base-pairing capability, i.e. to prevent
	misreading of near-cognate codons and reduce the efficiency of cognate
	codon reading, especially of codons ending in G. We have determined
	the influence of the 5-methylaminomethyl and the 2-thio modifications
	of mnm(5)s(2)U34 in {tRNA}(Glu) on the translation rate of the glutamate
	codons GAA and GAG \emph{in vivo}. In wild-type cells, GAG is translated
	slower (7.7 codons/second) and GAA faster (18 codons/second) than
	the average codon (13 codons/second). Surprisingly, {tRNA}(Glu) lacking
	the 5-methylaminomethyl group, thus containing s(2)U34, translated
	GAA twofold faster (47 codons/second) and GAG four-fold slower (1.9
	codons/second) than fully modified {tRNA}(Glu). In contrast, {tRNA}(Glu)
	that contains mnm(5)U34 instead of mnm(5)s(2)U34 translated GAA fourfold
	slower (4.5 codons/second) and GAG only 20\% slower (6.2 codons/second).
	Clearly, the 5-methylaminomethyl group of mnm(5)s(2)U34 facilitates
	base-pairing with G while decreasing base-pairing with A, resulting
	in rates of translation of GAG and GAA that approach that of the
	average codon. The 2-thio group increases the recognition of GAA
	and has only a minor effect on the decoding of GAG. Furthermore,
	the 2-thio group is important for aminoacylation (see the accompanying
	paper). These data imply that the function of mnm(5)s(2)U34 may be
	different from what has been suggested previously. (C) 1998 Academic

	The scenario involves substantial gene loss in fungi, nematodes,
	and insects. Based on this evolutionary scenario and estimates of
	the divergence times between major eukaryotic phyla, we introduce
	a numerical measure, the propensity for gene loss (PGL). We explore
	the connection among the propensity of a gene to be lost in evolution
	(PGL value), protein sequence divergence, the effect of gene knockout
	on fitness, the number of protein-protein interactions, and expression
	level for the genes in KOGs. Significant correlations between PGL

	propensity to be lost in eukaryotic evolution accumulate fewer substitutions
	in their protein sequences and tend to be essential for the organism
	viability, tend to be highly expressed, and have many interaction
	partners. The dependence between PGL and gene dispensability and
	interactivity is much stronger than that for sequence evolution rate.
	Thus, propensity of a gene to be lost during evolution seems to be
	a direct reflection of its biological importance.},

	is in the range of 1:10(5)-10(6). To make this principle practicable,
	encounter frequencies between DCs and T cells are maximized within
	lymph nodes (LNs) that are compact immunological projections of the

	places for DCs that immigrated from the tissue and lymphocytes that

	integrate the diversity of information on these species, understand
	mechanisms responsible for observed population dynamics, and assess
	management scenarios. We present a population model for blue mussels
	Mytilus edulis grown in suspended culture in 2 bays in Prince Edward
	Island, Canada. The model incorporates a number of ecological processes,
	namely allometric growth of individual mussels, temperature-dependent
	growth rates (based on the Lassiter-Kearns equation), and survival
	of mussels based on self-thinning. Analysis of our model suggests
	that the optimal temperature for mussel growth is 15.8 degrees C.
	Also, survival does not depend on site or year, indicating that self-thinning
	is probably due to competition for space rather than food or other
	site-specific conditions. Based on sensitivity analyses, growth predictions
	are robust to changes in parameter values, while survival predictions
	are quite sensitive to changes in the strength of the effect of initial
	mussel density and of self-thinning. Evaluation of management scenarios
	over one grow-out period indicates that date of deployment strongly
	affects time for seeds to reach commercial size. Optimal initial
	mussel density depends on whether one wants to maximise the proportion
	of mussels surviving to harvest or the number of mussels available
	at harvest; this decision depends on whether seed availability or
	lease area is limiting.},

	This article evaluates the evidence that has been used to support

  abstract = {Sequence polymorphisms affect gene expression by perturbing the complex
	network of regulatory interactions. We propose a probabilistic method,
	called Geronemo, which directly aims to identify the mechanism by
	which genetic changes perturb the regulatory network. Geronemo automatically
	constructs a set of coregulated genes (modules), whose regulation
	can involve both sequence variations and expression of regulators.
	By exploiting the modularity of genetic regulatory systems, Geronemo
	reveals regulatory relationships that are indiscernible when genes
	are considered in isolation, allowing the recovery of intricate combinatorial
	regulation. By incorporating both expression and genotype of regulators,
	Geronemo captures cases where the effect of sequence variation on
	its targets is indirect. We applied Geronemo to a data set from the
	progeny generated by a cross between laboratory BY4716 (BY) and wild
	RM11-1a (RM) isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Geronemo produced
	previously undescribed hypotheses regarding genetic perturbations
	in the yeast regulatory network, including transcriptional regulation,
	signal transduction, and chromatin modification. In particular, we
	find a large number of modules that have both chromosomal characteristics
	and are regulated by chromatin modification proteins. Indeed, a large
	fraction of the variance in the expression can be explained by a
	small number of markers associated with chromatin modifiers. Additional
	analysis reveals positive selection for sequence evolution of elements
	in the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex. Overall, our results
	suggest that a significant part of individual expression variation
	in yeast arises from evolution of a small number of chromatin structure

	of the evolutionary analysis of biological systems remains to decipher
	the causal connections between organism-wide (or genome-wide) attributes
	(e.g., {mRNA} abundance, protein length, codon bias, recombination
	rate, genomic position, mutation rate, etc) as well as their role-together
	with mutation, selection, and genetic drift-in shaping patterns of
	evolutionary variation in any of the attributes themselves. Here
	we combine genome-wide evolutionary analysis of protein and gene
	expression data to highlight fundamental relationships among genomic
	attributes and their associations with the evolution of both protein
	sequences and gene expression levels. Our results show that protein
	divergence is positively coupled with both gene expression polymorphism
	and divergence. We show moreover that although the number of protein-protein
	interactions in Drosophila is negatively associated with protein
	divergence as well as gene expression polymorphism and divergence,
	protein-protein interactions cannot account for the observed coupling
	between regulatory and structural evolution. Furthermore, we show
	that proteins with higher rates of amino acid substitutions tend
	to have larger sizes and tend to be expressed at lower {mRNA} abundances,
	whereas genes with higher levels of gene expression divergence and
	polymorphism tend to have shorter sizes and tend to be expressed
	at higher {mRNA} abundances. Finally, we show that protein length
	is negatively associated with both number of protein-protein interactions
	and {mRNA} abundance and that interacting proteins in Drosophila
	show similar amounts of divergence. We suggest that protein sequences
	and gene expression are subjected to similar evolutionary dynamics,
	possibly because of similarity in the fitness effect (i.e., strength
	of stabilizing selection) of disruptions in a gene's protein sequence
	or its {mRNA} expression. We conclude that, as more and better data
	accumulate, understanding the causal connections among biological
	traits and how they are integrated over time to constrain or promote
	structural and regulatory evolution may finally become possible.

	proofreading mechanism of aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) selection.
	Mathematical modeling using previously determined kinetic rate constants
	reveals that destabilization of deacylated tRNA in the E-site, rearrangement
	of peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site, and availability of cognate aa-tRNA
	corresponding to the A-site act synergistically to promote efficient
	1 PRF. The effect of E-site codon:anticodon interactions on 1 PRF

	construct. The combination of predictive modeling and empirical testing
	allowed the rate constant for P-site tRNA slippage (k(s)) to be estimated

	since the wobble A of the P-site {tRNA} weakens the codon-dependent
	binding of aminoacyl-{tRNA} at the A-site via interduplex interaction.
	Besides the canonical partner U, the wobble A of aminoacyl-{tRNA}
	can recognize A, C, G in the third position of the codon by the formation

	According to this the E-site wobble A should enhance the probability

	a reason why A is very rarely observed in the first anticodon position

	the efficiency of the selection falls off sharply. This suggests
	that the AP interduplex interaction should be retained during translocation

	that is identical with that of AP should exist to avoid frameshifting.
	In such a model the P-site duplex provides an indirect linkage between

  abstract = {Infections have long been thought to exert natural selection on humans.
	Infectious disease resistance is frequently invoked as a mechanism
	shaping human genetic diversity, but such hypotheses have rarely
	been quantitatively evaluated with direct measures of disease-related
	mortality. Enhancement of genetically determined resistance to tuberculosis
	by natural selection has been proposed as a factor explaining the
	decline of tuberculosis in Europe and North America in the period
	1830-1950 (before the advent of antimicrobial chemotherapy) and the
	apparently reduced susceptibility of Europeans and their descendants
	to tuberculosis infection and/or disease. We used Swedish vital statistics
	from 1891 to 1900 to estimate that individuals who escaped mortality
	from pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) during the European tuberculosis
	epidemic would have enjoyed a fitness advantage of 7-15\% per generation
	compared to individuals who were susceptible to PTB mortality; individuals
	wrath 50\% protection would have had a selection coefficient of 4-7\%/generation.
	Selection during the peak of the European TB epidemic could have
	substantially reduced the frequency of already rare alleles conferring
	increased susceptibility to PTB mortality, but only if the phenotypic
	effects of these alleles were very large. However, if resistant alleles
	were rare at the beginning of this period, 300 years would not have
	been long enough for such selection to increase their frequency to
	epidemiologically significant levels. Reductions in the frequency
	of rare susceptibility alleles could have played at most a small
	part in the decline of the epidemic in the century preceding 1950.
	Natural selection by PTB deaths during the European TB epidemic alone
	cannot account for the presently low level of TB disease observed
	among Europeans and their descendants just prior to the appearance
	of antibiotic treatment. }

	for the development of the evolutionary theories of aging is presented

	later experimentally validated by the existence of cell division
	limits. Afterwards, the theory of mutation accumulation of Peter
	Medawar and the theory modification by Charlesworth (late-life mortality
	plateau) are presented as well as the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis
	of George Williams, and the disposable soma theory of Kirkwood and
	Holliday. These theories are discussed in the light of the different
	research studies, which include studies on insulin signaling and
	longevity, the possibility that nuclear factor kappa B may be a major
	mediator of aging, studies of anti-aging Sirtuins and studies on
	heat shock proteins and longevity and on gene sets as biomarkers
	of aging. Finally, the proposals for future research in biogerontology,
	such as studies on the control of protein synthesis, validation of
	biomarkers of aging, understanding the biochemistry of longevity
	and research in the field of gerontologic pathology are presented.
	Likewise, further attention is suggested regarding the work on telomere

  abstract = {In many organisms, synonymous codon usage is biased by a history of
	natural selection. However, codon bias, itself, does not indicate
	that selection is ongoing; it may be a vestige of past selection.
	Simple statistical tests have been devised to infer ongoing selection
	on codon usage by comparing the derived state frequency spectra at
	polymorphic sites segregating either derived preferred codons or
	derived unpreferred codons; if selection is effective, the frequency
	of derived states should be higher in the former. We propose a new
	test that uses the inferred degree of preference, essentially calculating
	the correlation of derived state frequency and the difference in
	preference between the derived and the ancestral states; the correlation
	should be positive if selection is effective. When implementing the
	test, derived and ancestral states can be assigned by parsimony or
	on the basis of relative probability. In either case, statistical
	significance is estimated by a simple permutation test. We explored
	the statistical power of the test by sampling polymorphism data from
	14 loci in 16 strains of D. simulans, finding that the test retains
	80\% power even when quite a few of the data are discarded. The power
	of the test likely reflects better use of multiple features of the
	data, combining population frequencies of polymorphic variants and
	quantitative estimates of codon preferences. We also applied this
	novel test to 14 newly sequenced loci in five strains of D. mauritiana,

	(R-0) and infected cell life span, is central to the quantitative
	study of the within-host dynamics of viral diseases such as human
	immunodeficiency) virus, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. As these parameters
	can rarely be determined directly, they are usually estimated indirectly
	by fitting mathematical models to viral load data. This paper investigates
	how parameter estimates obtained by such procedures depend on the
	assumptions made concerning the viral life cycle. It finds that estimates
	of the basic reproductive e number obtained using viral load data
	collected during the initial stages of infection can depend quite
	sensitive on these assumptions. The use of models which neglect the
	intracellular delay before virion production can lead to set ere
	underestimates of R-0 and, hence, to overly optimistic predictions
	of how efficacious treatment must be in order to prevent or eradicate
	the disease. These results are also of importance for attempts at
	estimating R-0 from similar epidemiological data as there is a correspondence
	between within-host and between-host models. Estimates of the life
	span of infected cells obtained from viral load data collected during
	drug treatment studies also depend on the assumptions made in modelling
	the virus life cycle. The use of more realistic descriptions of the
	life cycle is seen to increase estimates of infected cell life span,
	in addition to providing a new explanation for the shoulder phase
	seen during drug treatment. This study highlights the limitations
	of what can be learnt by fitting mathematical models to infectious
	disease data T without detailed independent knowledge of the life

  abstract = {Cyathostomes are now the principle parasitic pathogen of the horse:
	a remarkable transformation during the last 25 years from virtual
	obscurity to focus of attention in equine parasitology. This rise
	to prominence coincides with the marked decrease in prevalence of
	large strongyle infections as a result of widespread use of modern
	anthelmintic compounds. On the basis that strongyle-associated diseases
	continue to commonly occur in the absence of these large strongyle
	species, clinical attention has turned to the pathogenicity of cyathostomes,
	Although many horses harbour burdens of tens of thousands of cyathostomes
	without developing detectable illness, these parasites can result
	in an inflammatory enteropathy affecting the caecum and colon. Although
	the principle clinical effect of cyathostomosis is weight loss, affected
	individuals may exhibit other signs including diarrhoea and/or subcutaneous
	oedema and/or pyrexia. Clinical cyathostomosis occurs more commonly
	in young horses in late winter/early spring but there is lifelong
	susceptibility to cyathostomes and they can cause clinical disease
	in any age of horse during any season. Animals with cyathostomosis
	often develop hypoalbuminaemia and/or neutrophilia but there are
	no clinicopathological features specific for the disease. Experimental
	infections with cyathostomes have resulted in both clinical and pathological
	features similar to those of naturally-occuring cyathostomosis cases.
	From the experimental infection studies, it is evident that cyathostomes
	are pathogenic at times of both penetration into and emergence from
	the large intestinal mucose. An unusual feature of cyathostome biology
	is the propensity for arrested larval development within the large
	intestinal mucosa for more than 2 years. From limited studies it
	appears that this arrested larval development is favoured by: feedback
	from luminal to mucosal worms; larger size of challenge dose of larvae
	and trickle (versus single bolus) infection. During arrested larval
	development cyathostomes have minimal susceptibility to all anthelmintic
	compounds. thus, limiting the effectiveness of therapeutic and/or
	control strategies, Although, the relative importance of individual
	cyathostomes is not known, the development of species-specific DNA
	methods for identification of cyathostomes provides a means by which
	the pathogenicity of different species might be established. (C)

  journal = {{BMC} Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Background: In testing for differential gene expression involving
	multiple serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) libraries, it
	is critical to account for both between and within library variation.
	Several methods have been proposed, including the t test, t(w) test,
	and an overdispersed logistic regression approach. The merits of
	these tests, however, have not been fully evaluated. Questions still
	remain on whether further improvements can be made. Results: In this
	article, we introduce an overdispersed log-linear model approach
	to analyzing SAGE; we evaluate and compare its performance with three
	other tests: the two-sample t test, t(w) test and another based on
	overdispersed logistic linear regression. Analysis of simulated and
	real datasets show that both the log-linear and logistic overdispersion
	methods generally perform better than the t and t(w) tests; the log-linear
	method is further found to have better performance than the logistic
	method, showing equal or higher statistical power over a range of
	parameter values and with different data distributions. Conclusion:
	Overdispersed log-linear models provide an attractive and reliable
	framework for analyzing SAGE experiments involving multiple libraries.
	For convenience, the implementation of this method is available through
	a user-friendly web-interface available at http://www.cbcb.duke.edu/sage.}

  journal = {Bmc Evolutionary Biology},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {8},
  abstract = {Background: Matings between different Saccharomyces sensu stricto
	yeast species produce sexually sterile hybrids, so individuals should
	avoid mating with other species. Any mechanism that reduces the frequency
	of interspecific matings will confer a selective advantage. Here
	we test the ability of two closely-related Saccharomyces sensu stricto
	species to select their own species as mates and avoid hybridisation.
	Results: We set up mate choice tests, using five independently isolated
	pairs of species, in which individual germinating spores were presented
	with the opportunity to mate either with a germinating spore of their
	own species or with a germinating spore of the other species. For
	all five strain pairs, whether a S. cerevisiae or S. paradoxus occupies
	the role of "chooser" strain, the level of hybridisation that is
	observed between the two species is significantly lower than would
	be expected if mates were selected at random. We also show that,
	overall, S. cerevisiae exhibited a stronger own-species preference
	than S. paradoxus. Conclusion: Prezygotic reproductive isolation
	is well known in higher organisms but has been largely overlooked
	in yeast, an important model microbe. Here we present the first report
	of prezygotic reproductive isolation in Saccharomyces. Prezygotic
	reproductive isolation may be important in yeast speciation or yeast
	species cohesion, and may have evolved to prevent wasted matings
	between different species. Whilst yeast has long been used as a genetic
	model system, little is known about yeast in the wild. Our work sheds
	light on an interesting aspect of yeast natural behaviour: their
	ability to avoid costly interspecific matings. },

	categories, and virus-free, latent, and infective insects, with parameters
	based on the transmission classes, vector population dynamics, immigration/emigration

	plants is a function of the density of infective insects, the number
	of plants visited per time, and the probability of transmitting the
	virus per plant visit. The rate of change in infective insects is
	a function of the density of infectious plants, the number of plants

	virus per plant visit. Numerical solutions of the differential equations
	were used to determine transitional and steady-state levels of disease
	incidence (d*); d* was also determined directly from the model parameters.
	Clear differences were found in disease development among the four
	transmission classes: nonpersistently transmitted (stylet borne [NP]);
	semipersistently transmitted (foregut-borne [SP]); circulative, persistently
	transmitted (CP); and propagative, persistently transmitted (PP),
	with the highest disease incidence (d) for the SP and CP classes
	relative to the others, especially at low insect density when there
	was no insect migration or when the vector status of emigrating insects
	was the same as that of immigrating ones. The PP and CP viruses were
	most affected by changes in vector longevity, rates of acquisition,

	least affected by changes in insect mobility. When vector migration
	was explicitly considered, results depended on the fraction of infective
	insects in the immigration pool and the fraction of dying and emigrating
	vectors replaced by immigrants. The PP and CP viruses were most sensitive
	to changes in these factors. Based on model parameters, the basic
	reproductive number (R-0)-number of new infected plants resulting
	from an infected plant introduced into a susceptible plans population-was

	incorporation of several new features, and key improvements over

	We applied this method to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, producing
	the most thorough and accurate annotation of potential virtual SAGE
	tags that is available today for this organism. The usefulness of
	this method is exemplified by the significant reduction of ambiguous
	cases in existing experimental SAGE data. In addition, we report
	new insights from the analysis of existing SAGE data. First, we found
	that experimental SAGE tags mapping onto introns, intronexon boundaries,
	and noncoding RNA elements are observed in all available SAGE data.
	Second, a significant fraction of experimental SAGE tags was found
	to map onto genomic regions currently annotated as intergenic. Third,
	a significant number of existing experimental SAGE tags for yeast
	has been derived from truncated cDNAs, which are synthesized through
	oligo-d(T) priming to internal poly-(A) regions during reverse transcription.
	Conclusion: We conclude that an accurate and unambiguous tag mapping
	process is essential to increase the quality and the amount of information
	that can be extracted from SAGE experiments. This is supported by
	the results obtained here and also by the large impact that the erroneous
	interpretation of these data could have on downstream applications.

	tDNAs, (3) frequencies of bases at each sequence position, (4) type
	and frequencies of conserved 2D and 3D base pairs, (5) anticodon/tDNA

	(8) occurrence and location of introns, (9) occurrence of 3'-CCA
	and 5'-extra G encoded at the tDNA level, and (10) distribution of
	the {tRNA} genes in genomes and their mode of transcription. Among
	all {tRNA} isoacceptors, we found that initiator tDNA-iMet is the
	most conserved across the three domains, yet domain-specific signatures
	exist. Also, according to which {tRNA} feature is considered (5'-extra

	CAU, presence of intron, absence of "two-out-of-three" reading mode

	or Eukarya. No common features between Eukarya and Bacteria not shared
	with Archaea could be unveiled. Thus, from the tRNomic point of view,
	Archaea appears as an "intermediate domain" between Eukarya and Bacteria.},

	haematobium} on its molluscan host \textit{Biomphalaria truncatus}.
	Parasitic castration has been observed by protozoa, helminths, and
	arthropods parasites. Assume that host repro rate decreases linearly
	with p load. Thus the equation describing parasite population growth
	doesn't change, only that for the host. Derive criteria for existance
	of an equilibrium. If equilibrium exists, stability criteria is $\alpha
	> \beta k$ where $\alpha$ is the added host mort/parasite, $\beta$
	is the decrease in host reprod. rate/parasite and $k$ is the negative
	binomial "clumping" parameter. "Equation (5) says that for a host
	pop. to be stably reg. by its parasites, it is necessary that the
	parasites' influence on host repro. be not too severe relativel to
	the parasite induced mortality (i.e. that $\beta$ be small relative
	to $\alpha$) and /or that the parasites be highly over dispersed
	($k$ small)." However, if $k$ is too small, not equil. exists. "parasite-induced
	dimnuation in host repro. (increased $\beta$) is destabilizing" while
	both overdispersion (small $k$) and density dep. parasite mort. (whether
	do to reg. within the host or via host mortality itself) propotes
	stability. Figures 3 and 4 are good summaries of this. Model E: Within-host
	parasite repro. Give an example of a human protozoan parasite (Entamoeba
	hystolytica) which reporduces within the host's gut and produces
	transmission stages. Model now includes a within-host repro. rate
	$r$. Find three possible outcomes: (1) Host pop. cannot be regulated,
	(2) Host population is regulated and the equilbrium is always stable
	(as long as $0\leq k < \infty$) and (3) parasite drives host population,
	and itself, extinct. "Too large a value of $r$ produces extinction;
	too small a value of $r$ can (derpending on the other parameter values)
	lead to unregulated host population growth." Adding density dep.
	parasite mort (e.g. immune response) increases the range of stable
	regulation. Note: from a broader perspective, when comparing model
	behavior and natural systems we are really only interested in whether
	or not the system should persist (i.e. not evolve to extinction),
	the question of regulation is secondary. Model F: Time delay b/w
	prod. of transmission stage and its maturation to being able to infect
	a host. First form is to just incorp. a time delay $T$, second form
	is to explicitly model infective stages. Found time delays can have
	a destabilizing effect. Conclusion: Cite Park (1948) and Lancinani
	(1975) as examples where parasites have been shown to affect host
	population growth rates. Also cite a study by Anderson, Whitfield,

	"increased pathogenicity may often be associated with enhanced rates
	of production (within a host) of the parasite's transmission stages"

	infections. (c) Expand model to include two loci Again comparing
	to results from Hamilton 1980 and again "these two locus systems

	tempo and mode of late Quaternary changes in the Arizona Upland.
	Evergreen woodland containing Pinus monophylla (singleleaf pinyon),
	Juniperus osteosperma (Utah juniper), and Quercus turbinella (shrub
	live oak) occupied the site during full glacial times. The latter
	two species, but not P. monophylla, persisted into the early Holocene
	and were joined by a limited number of desertscrub species, including
	Acacia greggii (catclaw), Carnegiea gigantea (saguaro), and several
	other succulents. With the arrival of many other species during the
	middle Holocene, a desertscrub community that differed considerably
	from the modem vegetation developed. Acacia greggii and Cercidium
	floridum (blue paloverde) were the principal large woody species
	on exposed hillslopes. Assemblages similar in composition to the
	modem desertscrub did not appear until approximately 4000 years ago,
	when the more xerophytic Cercidium microphyllum (foothills paloverde)
	arrived and C. floridum disappeared from hillslopes. The delayed
	arrival of C. microphyllum in comparison to other Sonoran Desertscrub
	species with similar climatic tolerances is attributed to the Limited
	dispersal distance of its seeds by seed-eating heteromyid rodents.
	At 4540 and 6425 yr B.P., the cold-intolerant shrub Encelia farinosa
	was present on northeasterly aspect exposures where it is absent
	today, suggesting slightly warmer winter conditions during the middle
	Holocene. The presence of the tree Cercidium floridum and the perennial,
	C-4 grass Setaria leucopila on exposed slopes during the middle Holocene
	indicates substantially moister conditions during that time than
	in the late Holocene or today. At sites on the xeric Limits of the
	modern distributions of both species, average annual precipitation
	is from 50\% to 100\% greater than that presently received at Eagle
	Eye Mountain. In particular, the responses of S. leucopila and cacti
	during the middle Holocene indicate substantial increases in warm-season
	precipitation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, CGG is a rare arginine codon occurring at a frequency
	of 0.54\% in all E coli mRNAs or 9.8\% when an arginine residue is
	encoded for. When present in high numbers or in clusters in highly
	expressed recombinant mRNA, rare codons can cause expression problems
	compromising product yield and translational fidelity. The coding
	region for an N-terminally polyhistidine tagged p27 protease domain
	from Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) contains 11 of these rare arginine
	codons, with 3 occurring in tandem near the C-terminus of the protein.
	When expressed in E coli, the majority of the recombinant material
	produced had an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa by SDS-PAGE gels
	or 3 kDa higher than predicted. Detailed biochemical analysis was
	performed on chemical and enzymatic digests of the protein and peptide
	fragments were characterized by Edman and MS/MS sequencing approaches.
	Two major species were isolated comprising +1 frameshift events at
	both the second and third CGG codons in the triplet cluster. Translation
	proceeded in the missense frame to the next termination codon. In
	addition, significant levels of glutamine misincorporating for arginine
	were discovered, suggesting second base misreading of CGG as CAG.
	Coexpression of the argX gene, which encodes the cognate tRNA for
	CGG codons, largely eliminated both the frameshift and misincorporation
	events, and increased expression levels of authentic product by up
	to 7-fold. We conclude that supplementation of the rare arginyl tRNACGG
	levels by coexpression of the argX gene can largely alleviate the
	CGG codon bias present in E coli, allowing for efficient and accurate
	translation of heterologous gene products. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

  abstract = {How to scale up from local-scale interactions to regional-scale dynamics
	is a critical issue in field ecology. We show how to implement a
	systematic approach to the problem of scaling up, using scale transition
	theory. Scale transition theory shows that dynamics on larger spatial
	scales differ from predictions based on the local dynamics alone
	because of an interaction between local-scale nonlinear dynamics
	and spatial variation in density or the environment. Based on this
	theory, a systematic approach to scaling up has four steps: (1) derive
	a model to translate the effects of local dynamics to the regional
	scale, and to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and
	spatial variation, (2) measure local-scale model parameters to determine
	nonlinearities at local scales, (3) measure spatial variation, and
	(4) combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale
	transition. We illustrate the approach, with an example from benthic
	stream ecology of caddisflies living in riffles. By sampling from
	a simulated system, we show how collecting the appropriate data at
	local (riffle) scales to measure nonlinearities, combined with measures
	of spatial variation, leads to the correct inference for dynamics
	at the larger scale of the stream. The approach provides a way to
	investigate the mechanisms and consequences of changes in population
	dynamics with spatial scale using a relatively small amount of field

	cells mutate to phenotypes of uncoordinated proliferation. We study
	basic principles of the architecture of solid tissues that influence
	the rate of cancer initiation. In particular, we explore how somatic

	in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes often have increased proliferation
	rates. Somatic selection increases their abundance and thus enhances
	the risk of cancer. Many potentially harmful mutations, however,
	increase the probability of triggering apoptosis and, hence, initially
	lead to cells with reduced net proliferation rates. Such cells are
	eliminated by somatic selection, which therefore also works to reduce
	the risk of cancer. We show that a tissue organization into small
	compartments avoids the rapid spread of mutations in oncogenes and
	tumor suppressor genes, but promotes genetic instability. In small
	compartments, genetic instability, which confers a selective disadvantage
	for the cell, can spread by random drift. If both deleterious and
	advantageous mutations participate in tumor initiation, then we find
	an intermediate optimum for the compartment size.},

	pathways in the majority of pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria
	and fungi. Considerable progress has been made in characterizing
	and understanding mechanisms of siderophore synthesis, secretion,
	iron scavenging, and siderophore-delivered iron uptake and its release.
	The regulation of siderophore pathways reveals multilayer networks
	at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Due to the
	key role of many siderophores during virulence, coevolution led to
	sophisticated strategies of siderophore neutralization by mammals
	and (re)utilization by bacterial pathogens. Surprisingly, hosts also
	developed essential siderophore-based iron delivery and cell conversion
	pathways, which are of interest for diagnostic and therapeutic studies.
	In the last decades, natural and synthetic compounds have gained
	attention as potential therapeutics for iron-dependent treatment
	of infections and further diseases. Promising results for pathogen
	inhibition were obtained with various siderophore-antibiotic conjugates
	acting as "Trojan horse" toxins and siderophore pathway inhibitors.
	In this article, general aspects of siderophore-mediated iron acquisition,
	recent findings regarding iron-related pathogen-host interactions,
	and current strategies for iron-dependent pathogen control will be

  volume = {7},
  abstract = {Background: Codon usage has direct utility in molecular characterization
	of species and is also a marker for molecular evolution. To understand
	codon usage within the diverse phylum Nematoda, we analyzed a total
	of 265,494 expressed sequence tags ( ESTs) from 30 nematode species.
	The full genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae were also
	examined. A total of 25,871,325 codons were analyzed and a comprehensive
	codon usage table for all species was generated. This is the first
	codon usage table available for 24 of these organisms. Results: Codon
	usage similarity in Nematoda usually persists over the breadth of
	a genus but then rapidly diminishes even within each clade. Globodera,
	Meloidogyne, Pristionchus, and Strongyloides have the most highly
	derived patterns of codon usage. The major factor affecting differences
	in codon usage between species is the coding sequence GC content,
	which varies in nematodes from 32\% to 51\%. Coding GC content (
	measured as GC3) also explains much of the observed variation in
	the effective number of codons (R = 0.70), which is a measure of
	codon bias, and it even accounts for differences in amino acid frequency.
	Codon usage is also affected by neighboring nucleotides (NI context).
	Coding GC content correlates strongly with estimated noncoding genomic
	GC content ( R = 0.92). On examining abundant clusters in five species,
	candidate optimal codons were identified that may be preferred in
	highly expressed transcripts. Conclusion: Evolutionary models indicate
	that total genomic GC content, probably the product of directional
	mutation pressure, drives codon usage rather than the converse, a
	conclusion that is supported by examination of nematode genomes.

  abstract = {The default framework for modeling biochemical processes is that of
	a constant-volume reactor operating under steady-state conditions.
	This is satisfactory for many applications, but not for modeling
	growth and division of cells. In this study, a whole-cell modeling
	framework is developed that assumes expanding volumes and a cell-division
	cycle. A spherical newborn cell is designed to grow in volume during
	the growth phase of the cycle. After 80\% of the cycle period, the
	cell begins to divide by constricting about its equator, ultimately
	affording two spherical cells with total volume equal to twice that
	of the original. The cell is partitioned into two regions or volumes,
	namely the cytoplasm (V-cyt) and membrane (V-mem), with molecular
	components present in each. Both volumes change during the cell cycle;
	V-cyt changes in response to osmotic pressure changes as nutrients
	enter the cell from the environment, while V-mem changes in response
	to this osmotic pressure effect such that membrane thickness remains
	invariant. The two volumes change at different rates; in most cases,
	this imposes periodic or oscillatory behavior on all components within
	the cell. Since the framework itself rather than a particular set
	of reactions and components is responsible for this behavior, it
	should be possible to model various biochemical processes within
	it, affording stable periodic solutions without requiring that the
	biochemical process itself generates oscillations as an inherent
	feature. Given that these processes naturally occur in growing and
	dividing cells, it is reasonable to conclude that the dynamics of
	component concentrations will be more realistic than when modeled
	within constant-volume and/or steady-state frameworks. This approach
	is illustrated using a symbolic whole cell model. (C) 2004 Elsevier

  abstract = {Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) is a technology for quantifying
	gene expression in biological tissue that yields count data that
	can be modeled by a multinomial distribution with two characteristics:
	skewness in the relative frequencies and small sample size relative
	to the dimension. As a result of these characteristics, a given SAGE
	sample may fail to capture a large number of expressed {mRNA} species
	present in the tissue. Empirical estimators of {mRNA} species' relative
	abundance effectively ignore these missing species, and as a result
	tend to overestimate the abundance of the scarce observed species
	comprising a vast majority of the total. We have developed a new
	Bayesian estimation procedure that quantifies our prior information
	about these characteristics, yielding a nonlinear shrinkage estimator
	with efficiency advantages over the MLE. Our prior is mixture of
	Dirichlets, whereby species are stochastically partitioned into abundant
	and scarce classes, each with its own multivariate prior. Simulation
	studies reveal our estimator has lower integrated mean squared error
	(IMSE) than the MLE for the SAGE scenarios simulated, and yields
	relative abundance profiles closer in Euclidean distance to the truth
	for all samples simulated. We apply our method to a SAGE library
	of normal colon tissue, and discuss its implications for assessing
	differential expression. },

	In the present work, we have taken 4065 rice-Arabidopsis homologous

	differ: The protein length versus expression curve for C-elegans},
  journal = {Bmc Genomics},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {5},
  abstract = {Background: Various methods for estimating protein expression levels
	are known. The level of correlation between these methods is only
	fair, and systematic biases in each of the methods cannot be ruled
	out. We here investigate systematic biases in the estimation of gene
	expression rates from microarray data and from abundance within the
	Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database. We suggest that length is
	a significant factor in biases to measured gene expression rates.
	As a specific example of the importance of the bias of expression
	rate with length, we address the following evolutionary question:
	Does the average C. elegans protein length increase or decrease with
	expression level? Two different answers to this question have been
	reported in the literature, one method using expression levels estimated
	by abundance within the EST database and another using microarrays.
	We have investigated this issue by constructing the full protein
	length versus expression curve for C. elegans, using both methods
	for estimating expression levels. Results: The microarray data show
	a monotonic decrease of length with expression level, whereas the
	abundance within the EST database data show a non-monotonic behavior.
	Furthermore, the ratio of the expression level estimated by the EST
	database to that measured by microarrays is not constant, but rather
	systematically biased with gene length. Conclusions: It is suggested
	that the length bias may lie primarily in the abundance within the
	EST database method, being not ameliorated by internal standards
	as it is in the microarray data, and that this bias should be removed
	before data interpretation. When this is done, both the microarray
	and the abundance within the EST database give a monotonic decrease
	of spliced length with expression level, and the correlation between
	the EST and microarray data becomes larger. We suggest that standard
	RNA controls be used to normalize for length bias in any method that
	measures expression. },

	(PI): one infected animal at 9 weeks PI, four animals (three infected,

	a marked reduction in weight gain and two animals developed clinical
	disease: one pony developed intermittent diarrhoea and colic 8 weeks
	PI; another pony developed intermittent diarrhoea between 30 and
	52 weeks PI. All infected ponies had decreased serum fructosamine
	concentrations and five had decreased serum albumin, which were first
	apparent 4-6 weeks PI, Alterations in the composition of serum globulins
	were detected in all ponies. Transient neutrophilia was observed
	in five animals from the infected groups 3-9 weeks PI. Serum alkaline
	phosphatase concentrations were increased in one pony between 30

  abstract = {1. We studied the effect of parasitism on snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus)
	survival through a field experiment that reduced natural burdens
	of sublethal nematodes in a free-ranging hare population. We treated
	half the hares on each of six study areas year-round with an anthelminthic
	drug, and the other half with a placebo. Potential interactive effects
	of parasitism and nutrition were examined by supplementing the natural
	food supply on three of the six study areas during two winters. Survival
	was measured by radio-collaring a total of 612 hares with mortality-sensitive
	transmitters and monitoring survival daily between April 1991 and
	June 1993. 2. Overall, nematode burdens in hares were highest between
	March and October, and Obeliscoides cuniculi was the most abundant
	of the five species present. The proximate cause of 95PERCENT of
	mortalities (n = 318) during the study was predation. Predators killed
	hares with heavy burdens of O. cuniculi disporportionately during
	May-June, but burdens of the four other species (Nematodirus triangularis,
	Trichuris leporis, Dirofilaria scapiceps, Protostrongylus boughtoni)
	were similar between predator-killed hares and the live population.
	3. During May-October 1991, the anthelminthic treatment did not affect
	hare survival, but during May-October 1992 survival of parasite-reduced
	hares was 2.4-times higher than that of controls. During November
	1991-April 1992 survival of food supplemented hares was 21PERCENT
	higher than food-normal animals, but survival was similar during
	November 1992-April 1993. 4. The effect of parasite-reduction on
	hare survival was apparently contingent on overwinter food supplies
	between November 1991 and April 1992, with survival being highest
	in hares subjected to both treatments, intermediate in those receiving
	only food supplementation, and lowest in unfed hares. We conclude
	that the effect of sublethal nematode parasitism on hare survival
	can be important if interactive with predation, and that synergistic
	effects of parasitism and nutrition may affect hares if food availability
	is limited. }

	selective sweep in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum that
	involves adaptive genome rearrangements. Amplification in copy number
	of genome regions containing the pfmdr1 gene on chromosome 5 confer
	resistance to mefloquine and spread rapidly in the 1990s. Using flanking
	microsatellite data and real-time polymerase chain reaction determination
	of copy number, we show that 5-15 independent amplification events
	have occurred in parasites on the Thailand/Burma border. The amplified
	genome regions (amplicons) range in size from 14.7 to 49 kb and contain
	2-11 genes, with 2-4 copies arranged in tandem. To examine the impact
	of drug selection on flanking variation, we genotyped 48 microsatellites
	on chromosome 5 in 326 parasites from a single Thai location. Diversity
	was reduced in a 170to 250-kb (10-15 cM) region of chromosomes containing
	multiple copies of pfmdr1, consistent with hitchhiking resulting
	from the rapid recent spread of selected chromosomes. However, diversity
	immediately flanking pfmdr1 is reduced by only 42\% on chromosomes
	bearing multiple amplicons relative to chromosomes carrying a single
	copy. We highlight 2 features of these results: 1) All amplicon break
	points occur in monomeric A/T tracts (9-45 bp). Given the abundance
	of these tracts in P. falciparum, we expect that duplications will
	occur frequently at multiple genomic locations and have been underestimated
	as drivers of phenotypic evolution in this pathogen. 2) The signature
	left by the spread of amplified genome segments is broad, but results
	in only limited reduction in diversity. If such "soft" sweeps are
	common in nature, statistical methods based on diversity reduction
	may be inefficient at detecting evidence for selection in genome-wide
	marker screens. This may be particularly likely when mutation rate
	is high, as appears to be the case for gene duplications, and in
	pathogen populations where effective population sizes are typically

	over a range of approximately 10-300 uredinia on the leaf, Total
	urediniospore production per uredinium generally decreased with increasing
	inoculum or uredinial density. At high densities, sporulation per

  abstract = {The modest correlation between {mRNA} expression and protein abundance
	in large-scale data sets is explained in part by experimental challenges,
	such as technological limitations, and in part by fundamental biological
	factors in the transcription and translation processes. Among various
	factors affecting the {mRNA}-protein correlation, the roles of biological
	factors related to translation are poorly understood. In this study,
	using experimental {mRNA} expression and protein abundance data collected
	from Desulfovibrio vulgaris by DNA microarray and liquid chromatography
	coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomic analysis,
	we quantitatively examined the effects of several translational-efficiency-related
	sequence features on {mRNA}-protein correlation. Three classes of
	sequence features were investigated according to different translational
	stages: (i) initiation, Shine-Dalgarno sequences, start codon identity,
	and start codon context; (ii) elongation, codon usage and amino acid
	usage; and (iii) termination, stop codon identity and stop codon
	context. Surprisingly, although it is widely accepted that translation
	initiation is the rate-limiting step for translation, our results
	showed that the {mRNA}-protein correlation was affected the most
	by the features at elongation stages, i.e., codon usage and amino
	acid composition (5.3-15.7\% and 5.8-11.9\% of the total variation
	of {mRNA}-protein correlation, respectively), followed by stop codon
	context and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (3.7-5.1\% and 1.9-3.8\%,
	respectively). Taken together, all sequence features contributed
	to 15.2-26.2\% of the total variation of {mRNA}-protein correlation.
	This study provides the first comprehensive quantitative analysis
	of the {mRNA}-protein correlation in bacterial D. vulgaris and adds
	new insights into the relative importance of various sequence features
	in prokaryotic protein translation. },

  journal = {Biochimie},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {88},
  pages = {963-992},
  abstract = {Thirty years of kinetic studies on tRNA selection in the elongation
	cycle are reviewed, and confronted with results derived from various
	sources, including structural studies on the ribosome, genetic observations
	on ribosome and EF-Tu accuracy mutants, and codon-specific elongation
	rates. A coherent framework is proposed, which gives meaning to many
	puzzling effects. Ribosomal accuracy would be governed by a "double-trigger"
	principle, according to which the ribosome uses energy in the forward
	direction to create new configurations for tRNA selection, and energy
	in the backward direction to regain its initial configuration, in
	particular after a premature dissociation event. The conformation
	energy would come in part, in Hopfield's mode, from GTP cleavage
	on the ternary complex (TC). The reset energy would be provided in
	part, in the author's mode, from GTP cleavage on a binary EF-Tu.GTP
	complex (BC). There would be several paths for amino acid incorporation.
	The path of highest accuracy would involve TC binding followed by
	BC binding, followed either by GTP hydrolysis on the TC, or by TC
	dissociation and GTP hydrolysis on the BC. Codon-anticodon recognition
	would occur in at least three kinetically and geometrically distinct
	stages. In a first stage, there would be a very rapid sorting of
	the TCs with unstrained anticodons contacting a loosely held mRNA.
	This stage ends with the anchoring of the codon-anticodon complex
	by a cluster of three nucleotides of 16S RNA. The second stage would
	be the most discriminative one. It would operate on the 5 ms time
	scale and terminate with GTP cleavage on the TC. The third stage
	would provide a last, crude selection involving "naked" aa-tRNA,
	partially held back by steric hindrance. Streptomycin and most EF-Tu
	mutants as well as high accuracy ribosomal mutants would produce
	specific alterations at stage 2, which are mapped on the stage 2
	kinetic mechanism. The ram ribosomal ambiguity mutants, and anticodon
	position 37 modifications could be markers of stages 1 and 3 selection.
	Dissociation events at stage 2 or stage 3, when they are not immediately
	followed by reset events create a leaky state favorable to shortcut
	incorporation events. These events are equivalent to an "error-prone
	codon-anticodon mismatch repair". From the recent evidence on ribosome
	structure, it is conjectured that the L7/L12 flexible stalk of the
	large ribosome subunit acts as a proofreading gate, and that the
	alternation of its GTPase activation center between "TCase" competence
	and "BCase" competence is a main factor in the control of accuracy.

	The slow component with a diffusion time of 6 ms appeared to be related

  title = {Evolution of the genetic code: partial optimization of a random code
	for robustness to translation error in a rugged fitness landscape},
  journal = {Biology Direct},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {2},
  abstract = {Background: The standard genetic code table has a distinctly non-random
	structure, with similar amino acids often encoded by codons series
	that differ by a single nucleotide substitution, typically, in the
	third or the first position of the codon. It has been repeatedly
	argued that this structure of the code results from selective optimization
	for robustness to translation errors such that translational misreading
	has the minimal adverse effect. Indeed, it has been shown in several
	studies that the standard code is more robust than a substantial
	majority of random codes. However, it remains unclear how much evolution
	the standard code underwent, what is the level of optimization, and
	what is the likely starting point. Results: We explored possible
	evolutionary trajectories of the genetic code within a limited domain
	of the vast space of possible codes. Only those codes were analyzed
	for robustness to translation error that possess the same block structure
	and the same degree of degeneracy as the standard code. This choice
	of a small part of the vast space of possible codes is based on the
	notion that the block structure of the standard code is a consequence
	of the structure of the complex between the cognate tRNA and the
	codon in mRNA where the third base of the codon plays a minimum role
	as a specificity determinant. Within this part of the fitness landscape,
	a simple evolutionary algorithm, with elementary evolutionary steps
	comprising swaps of four-codon or two-codon series, was employed
	to investigate the optimization of codes for the maximum attainable
	robustness. The properties of the standard code were compared to
	the properties of four sets of codes, namely, purely random codes,
	random codes that are more robust than the standard code, and two
	sets of codes that resulted from optimization of the first two sets.
	The comparison of these sets of codes with the standard code and
	its locally optimized version showed that, on average, optimization
	of random codes yielded evolutionary trajectories that converged
	at the same level of robustness to translation errors as the optimization
	path of the standard code; however, the standard code required considerably
	fewer steps to reach that level than an average random code. When
	evolution starts from random codes whose fitness is comparable to
	that of the standard code, they typically reach much higher level
	of optimization than the standard code, i.e., the standard code is
	much closer to its local minimum (fitness peak) than most of the
	random codes with similar levels of robustness. Thus, the standard
	genetic code appears to be a point on an evolutionary trajectory
	from a random point (code) about half the way to the summit of the
	local peak. The fitness landscape of code evolution appears to be
	extremely rugged, containing numerous peaks with a broad distribution
	of heights, and the standard code is relatively unremarkable, being
	located on the slope of a moderate-height peak. Conclusion: The standard
	code appears to be the result of partial optimization of a random
	code for robustness to errors of translation. The reason the code
	is not fully optimized could be the trade-off between the beneficial
	effect of increasing robustness to translation errors and the deleterious
	effect of codon series reassignment that becomes increasingly severe
	with growing complexity of the evolving system. Thus, evolution of
	the code can be represented as a combination of adaptation and frozen
	accident. Reviewers: This article was reviewed by David Ardell, Allan
	Drummond ( nominated by Laura Landweber), and Rob Knight. Open Peer

	1-7) independent survival traits, each controlled by a single locus.
	I investigated the influence of carrying capacity (K), mutation rate
	(it), number of beneficial mutations per generation (approximated
	by M = 2Ku) and net reproductive rate (R). Of these, M has the predominant
	influence. The effect of large changes in R was relatively small.
	The cost of selection (C) was measured as the shortest number of
	generations between an allelic substitution at all loci under selection
	that was consistent with population persistence. The results differed
	from Haldane's solution. Across a range of conditions, the cost of
	Simultaneous selection at n loci was determined by the linear relationship
	C = C-0(M) + nC(1)(M), where C-0(M) is the intercept and C-1(M) is
	the slope of the linear regression of C on n, for a given M. The
	intercept defined a positive fixed cost of substitution, that appears
	to reflect genetic deaths occurring during the stochastic phase when
	the beneficial alleles are rare. For M > 1/2, the cost of natural
	selection is substantially less than Haldane's estimate; however,
	when M < 1/2, the cost (and particularly the fixed cost) increases
	in an accelerating fashion as M is lowered. This result has important
	implications for conserved populations, since for u approximate to
	5 x 10(-6) the carrying capacity of the population must be 50000
	for M = 1/2. To avoid low M, smaller populations should be linked
	together into a large metapopulation whenever possible. This large
	unit would be capable of adapting when the isolated parts could not.
	It also suggests that if M much less than 1, small gains in K through
	increases in habitat can have a very large positive influence on
	the future survival of the population in a changing environment.

	As classical genetics regards the phenomenon of dominance to be generated
	by intralocus interactions, we have studied two one-locus models,
	one with a negative autoregulatory feedback loop, and one with a
	positive autoregulatory feedback loop. To include the phenomena of
	epistasis and downstream regulatory effects, a model of a three-locus
	signal transduction network is also analyzed. It is found that genetic
	dominance as well as overdominance may be an intra- as well as interlocus
	interaction phenomenon. In the latter case the dominance phenomenon
	is intimately connected to either feedback-mediated epistasis or
	downstream-mediated epistasis. It appears that in the intra- as well
	as the inter-locus case there is considerable room for additive gene
	action, which may explain to some degree the predictive power of
	quantitative genetic theory,with its emphasis on this type of gene
	action. Furthermore, the results illuminate and reconcile the prevailing

	These include circumstances where the virus initially invades a compartment

	seen when the receptor was expressed on mammalian cells; however,
	that was sufficient to allow endocytosis and infection. The apical
	domain of the canine TfR controls the specific interaction with CPV
	capsids, as a canine TfR mutant altering a glycosylation site in
	that domain bound FPV, CPV-2, and CPV-2b capsids efficiently. Enzymatic

	After fewer than 200 bacterial generations, 25\% of the populations
	coevolving with phages had evolved 10- to 100-fold increases in mutation
	rates owing to mutations in mismatch-repair genes; no populations
	evolving in the absence of phages showed any significant change in

  abstract = {During most of the 20th cenury, the epidemiology, of tick-borne rickettsioses
	could be summarized as the occurrence of a single pathogenic rickettsia
	on each continent. An element of this paradigm suggested that the
	many other characterized and noncharacterized rickettsiae isolated
	from ticks were not pathogenic to humans. In this context, it was
	considered that relatively few tick-borne rickettsiae caused human
	disease. This concept was modified extensively from 1984 through
	2005 by the identification of at least 11hitherto unavailable, such

	resistance to viral infection, and phylogenetic evidence of the history
	of host range shifts in arboviruses. However, glaring gaps in knowledge
	of many critical subjects, such as the mechanism of viral persistence
	and the existence of vertebrate reservoirs, are still evident. Furthermore,
	with the accumulated data, new questions were raised, such as evolutionary
	directions of virus virulence and of host range. Although many fundamental
	questions on the evolution of this unique mode of transmission remained
	unresolved in the absence of a fossil record, available observations
	for arboviruses and the information derived from studies in other
	fields of the biological sciences suggested convergent evolution
	as a plausible process. Overall, discussion of the diverse range
	of theories proposed and observations made by many investigators
	was found to be highly valuable for sorting out the possible mechanism
	(s) of the emergence of arboviral diseases. additional rickettsial

	More people are hence living long enough to suffer age-related loss
	of function and disease, and there is a need to improve the health
	of older people. Ageing is a complex process of damage accumulation,
	and has been viewed as experimentally and medically intractable.
	This view has been reinforced by the realization that ageing is a
	disadvantageous trait that evolves as a side effect of mutation accumulation
	or a benefit to the young, because of the decline in the force of
	natural selection at later ages. However, important recent discoveries
	are that mutations in single genes can extend lifespan of laboratory
	model organisms and that the mechanisms involved are conserved across
	large evolutionary distances, including to mammals. These mutations
	keep the animals functional and pathology-free to later ages, and
	they can protect against specific ageing-related diseases, including
	neurodegenerative disease and cancer. Preliminary indications suggest
	that these new findings from the laboratory may well also apply to
	humans. Translating these discoveries into medical treatments poses
	new challenges, including changing clinical thinking towards broad-spectrum,

  abstract = {The identification of key environmental forcings responsible for population
	patterns is a pervasive ecological problem and an important application
	of time series analysis. A common approach, implemented with methods
	such as cross-correlation and cross-spectral analysis, relies on
	matching scales of variability. This approach concludes that a population
	pattern is caused by a physical factor if their variances share a
	dominant period. In a nonlinear system, however, forcing at one temporal
	period can produce a response with variability at one or more different
	periods. Thus, scale-matching methods will be most successful at
	establishing cause-effect relationships in linear systems, or close
	to equilibria, where nonlinear systems are well approximated by linear
	ones. Here, we propose an alternative approach that does not assume
	linearity and relies on time series models that are both nonlinear
	and nonparametric. We specifically apply these models to determine
	the correct but unknown frequency of a periodic forcing. The time
	series are generated by simulation of a predator-prey model. Under
	periodic forcing, this type of model is known to be capable of different
	dynamic regimes, including chaos and quasiperiodicity, in which the
	power spectra of population numbers exhibit variance at frequencies
	other than that of the forcing. We show that nonlinear time series
	models, built with feedforward neural networks, are able to distinguish
	the correct forcing period in the predator-prey simulations. These
	results hold under two common limitations of ecological data: the
	presence of dynamical and measurement noise, and the availability
	of time series data for only one variable. We discuss future applications
	of the approach to more general environmental forcings, other than

	In such regions, apparent evolutionary context dependencies exist,
	both between nucleotides occupying the same codon and between nucleotides
	forming a base pair in the RNA structure. The overlap of these fundamental
	dependencies is sufficient to cause "contagious" context dependencies
	which cascade across many nucleotide sites. Such large-scale dependencies
	challenge the use of traditional phylogenetic models in evolutionary
	inference because they explicitly assume evolutionary independence
	between short nucleotide tuples. In our model we address this by
	replacing context dependencies within codons by annotation-specific
	heterogeneity in the substitution process. Through a general procedure,
	we fragment the alignment into sets of short nucleotide tuples based
	on both the protein coding and the structural annotation. These individual
	tuples are assumed to evolve independently, and the different tuple
	sets are assigned different annotation-specific substitution models
	shared between their members. This allows us to build a composite
	model of the substitution process from components of traditional
	phylogenetic models. We applied this to a data set of full-genome
	sequences from the hepatitis C virus where five RNA structures are
	mapped within the coding region. This allowed us to partition the
	effects of selection on different structural elements and to test
	various hypotheses concerning the relation of these effects. Of particular
	interest, we found evidence of a functional role of loop and bulge
	regions, as these were shown to evolve according to a different and
	more constrained selective regime than the nonpairing regions outside
	the RNA structures. Other potential applications of the model include
	comparative RNA structure prediction in coding regions and RNA virus

	MHC-dependent mating preference increases the MHC-heterozygosity

	increased resistance to hepatitis and HIV infections, but experimental

	A second (nonmutually exclusive) possibility is that MHC-disassortative
	mating preferences promotes inbreeding avoidance. This hypothesis
	is supported by recent evidence that MHC genes play a role in kin

	Amino acid conservation in orthologous comparisons with wholly sequenced
	microbial genomes was used to estimate translational accuracy requirements.
	A close correspondence was observed between the usage of wobble position
	pyrimidines and the frequency predicted by mutational bias. However,
	in the case of four cognate pairs (Gly: ggu/ggc; Asn: aau/aac; Phe:
	uuu/uuc; Tyr: uau/uac) all read by guanosine-starting anticodons,

	selection is strictly related to the number of hydrogen bonds formed
	by alternative cognate codons: whenever a different number of hydrogen
	bonds can be formed at the wobble position, there is selection against
	sixor nine-hydrogen-bonded codon-anticodon pairs. Our results indicate
	that an intrinsic codon preference, critically dependent on the stability

	exerts constraints on codon usage, it is common to use tables containing

	is that some important properties of correspondence analysis, such

	the quantity of information to analyse, occasionally resulting in

	conclusion that there was no translational selection, while analyses
	based on codon counts show that there is a possibility of a selective

	of advantageous genotypes that are disproportionately rare because
	of fluctuating epistasis. However, for this mechanism to work, epistasis
	for fitness must fluctuate over a very narrow timescale: two to five
	generations. Alternatively, recombination may speed up the response
	to directional selection by breaking up linkage disequilibria that
	decrease additive genetic variance. Here we analyze the results of
	a numerical simulation of host-parasite coevolution to assess the
	importance of these two mechanisms. We find that linkage disequilibria
	may tend to increase, rather than decrease, additive genetic variance.
	In addition, the sign of epistasis changes every two to five generations
	under several of the parameter values investigated, and epistasis
	and linkage disequilibrium are frequently of opposite signs. These
	results are consistent with the idea that selection for recombination
	is mediated by fluctuating epistasis. Finally, we explore the conditions
	under which an allele causing free recombination can spread in a
	nonrecombining host population and find general agreement between
	the predictions of a population genetic model of fluctuating epistasis

	a level of virulence confers high fitness to the pathogen in one
	host phenotype but low fitness in another host phenotype, alternative
	virulence strategies may be maintained in the pathogen population.
	Such strategies can occur either as polymorphism, where different
	strains of pathogen evolve specialized virulence strategies in different
	host phenotypes or as polyphenism, where pathogens facultatively
	express alternative virulence strategies depending on host phenotype.
	Polymorphism potentially leads to specialist pathogens capable of
	infecting a limited range of host phenotypes, whereas polyphenism
	potentially leads to generalist pathogens capable of infecting a
	wider range of hosts. Evaluating how variation among hosts affects

  abstract = {The tri-frame model gives mathematical expression to the transcription
	and translation processes, and considers all three reading frames
	(RFs). RNA polymerases transcribe DNA in single nucleotide increments,
	but ribosomes translate mRNA in pairings of three (triplets or codons).
	The set of triplets in the mRNA, starting with the initiation codon
	(usually AUG) defines the open reading frame (ORF). Since ribosomes
	do not always translocate three nucleotide positions, two additional
	RFs are accessible. The -1 RF and the +1 RF are triplet pairings
	of the mRNA, which are accessed by shifting one nucleotide position
	in the 5' and 3' directions, respectively. Transcription is modeled
	as a linear operator that maps the initial codons in all three frames
	into other codon sets to account for possible transcriptional errors.
	Translational errors (missense errors) originate from misacylation
	of tRNAs and misreading of aa-tRNAs by the ribosome. Translation
	is modeled as a linear mapping from codons into aa-tRNA species,
	which includes misreading errors. A final transformation from aa-tRNA
	species into amino acids provides the probability distributions of
	possible amino acids into which the codons in all three frames could
	be translated. An important element of the tri-frame model is the
	ribosomal occupancy probability. It is a vector in R(3) that gives
	the probability to find the ribosome in the ORF, -1 or +1 RF at each
	codon position. The sequence of vectors, from the first to the final
	codon position, gives a history of ribosome frameshifting. The model
	is powerful: it provides explicit expressions for (1) yield of error-free
	protein, (2) fraction of prematurely terminated polypeptides, (3)
	number of transcription errors, (4) number of translation errors
	and (5) mutations due to frameshifting. The theory is demonstrated
	for the three genes rpsU, dnaG and rpoD of Escherichia coli, which

	pressures on proteins on the basis of their synonymous codon usage
	(Plotkin and Dushoff 2003; Plotkin et al. 2004). Here we provide
	a theoretical foundation for this approach. Under the Fisher-Wright
	model, we derive the expected frequencies of synonymous codons as
	a function of the strength of selection on amino acids, the mutation
	rate, and the effective population size. We analyze the conditions
	under which we can expect to draw inferences from biased codon usage,

	such a signal. We find that synonymous codon usage can reliably distinguish
	between negative selection and neutrality only for organisms, such
	as some microbes, that experience large effective population sizes
	or periods of elevated mutation rates. The power of volatility to
	detect positive selection is also modest-requiring approximately
	100 selected sites-but it depends less strongly on population size.
	We show that phenomena such as transient hyper-mutators can improve
	the power of volatility to detect selection, even when the neutral
	site heterozygosity is low. We also discuss several confounding factors,
	neglected by the Fisher-Wright model, that may limit the applicability

	J. Theor. Biol. 113: 475{\textendash}500; Mayo O. and Reinhard B.
	1997. Biol. Rev. 72: 97{\textendash}110] have argued that dominance
	evolved via selection on modifier genes. Some have called these {\textquotedblleft}physiological{\textquotedblright}
	versus {\textquotedblleft}selectionist,{\textquotedblright} or more
	recently [Falk R. 2001. Biol. Philos. 16: 285{\textendash}323], {\textquotedblleft}functional,{\textquotedblright}

	these explanations as exclusive. While one can disagree about the
	most likely evolutionary explanation of dominance, as Wright and
	Fisher did, offering a {\textquotedblleft}physiological{\textquotedblright}
	or developmental explanation of dominance does not render dominance
	{\textquotedblleft}epiphenomenal,{\textquotedblright} nor show that
	evolutionary considerations are irrelevant to the maintenance of
	dominance, as some [Kacser H. and Burns J.A. 1981. Genetics 97: 639{\textendash}666]
	have argued. Recent work [Gilchrist M.A. and Nijhout H.F. 2001. Genetics
	159: 423{\textendash}432] illustrates how biological explanation
	is a multi-level task, requiring both a {\textquotedblleft}top-down{\textquotedblright}

	Some of the limitations inherent in predictions for the emergence

	mutations, which restore fitness losses incurred by other mutations,
	in a context-dependent manner. We have conducted a moment analysis
	of the model, supplemented by the numerical results of computer simulations.
	The mean reduction of fitness (i.e., expected load) scaled to one
	is approximately nl(n+2N(e)), where N-e is the effective population
	size. The reciprocal relationship between the load and N-e implies
	that the fixation of deleterious mutations is unlikely to cause extinction
	when there is a broad scope for compensatory mutations, except in
	very small populations. Furthermore, the dependence of load on n
	implies that pleiotropy plays a large role in determining the extinction
	risk of small populations. Differences and similarities between our
	results and those of a previous study on the effects of N-e and n
	are explored. That the predictions of this model are qualitatively
	different from studies ignoring compensatory mutations implies that

	HIV-1-negative and followed them prospectively for up to 30 months.
	The incidence of HIV-1 infection per 100 person-years among the initially
	seronegative partners was examined in relation to behavioral and
	biologic variables. Results: The male partner was HIV-1-positive
	in 228 couples, and the female partner was HIV-1-positive in 187
	couples. Ninety of the 415 initially HIV-1-negative partners seroconverted
	(incidence, 11.8 per 100 person-years). The rate of male-to-female
	transmission was not significantly different from the rate of female-to-male
	transmission (12.0 per 100 person-years vs. 11.6 per 100 person-years).
	The incidence of seroconversion was highest among the partners who
	were 15 to 19 years of age (15.3 per 100 person-years). The incidence
	was 16.7 per 100 person-years among 137 uncircumcised male partners,

	higher among HIV-1-positive subjects whose partners seroconverted

	no instances of transmission among the 51 subjects with serum HIV-1
	RNA levels of less than 1500 copies per milliliter; there was a significant
	dose-response relation of increased transmission with increasing
	viral load. In multivariate analyses of log-transformed HIV-1 RNA
	levels, each log increment in the viral load was associated with
	a rate ratio of 2.45 for seroconversion (95 percent confidence interval,
	1.85 to 3.26). Conclusions: The viral load is the chief predictor

  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Background: A large number of papers have been published on analysis
	of microarray data with particular emphasis on normalization of data,
	detection of differentially expressed genes, clustering of genes
	and regulatory network. On other hand there are only few studies
	on relation between expression level and composition of nucleotide/protein
	sequence, using expression data. There is a need to understand why
	particular genes/proteins express more in particular conditions.
	In this study, we analyze 3468 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
	obtained from Holstege et al., ( 1998) to understand the relationship
	between expression level and amino acid composition. Results: We
	compute the correlation between expression of a gene and amino acid
	composition of its protein. It was observed that some residues (
	like Ala, Gly, Arg and Val) have significant positive correlation
	( r > 0.20) and some other residues ( Like Asp, Leu, Asn and Ser)
	have negative correlation ( r < - 0.15) with the expression of genes.
	A significant negative correlation ( r = - 0.18) was also found between
	length and gene expression. These observations indicate the relationship
	between percent composition and gene expression level. Thus, attempts
	have been made to develop a Support Vector Machine ( SVM) based method
	for predicting the expression level of genes from its protein sequence.
	In this method the SVM is trained with proteins whose gene expression
	data is known in a given condition. Then trained SVM is used to predict
	the gene expression of other proteins of the same organism in the
	same condition. A correlation coefficient r = 0.70 was obtained between
	predicted and experimentally determined expression of genes, which
	improves from r = 0.70 to 0.72 when dipeptide composition was used
	instead of residue composition. The method was evaluated using 5-fold
	cross validation test. We also demonstrate that amino acid composition
	information along with gene expression data can be used for improving
	the function classification of proteins. Conclusion: There is a correlation
	between gene expression and amino acid composition that can be used
	to predict the expression level of genes up to a certain extent.
	A web server based on the above strategy has been developed for calculating
	the correlation between amino acid composition and gene expression

	Using bicistronic ACT1-LUC constructs, elongating yeast ribosomes
	were found to maintain the competence to (re)initiate over only short
	distances. Thus, as the first ORF to be translated is progressively
	truncated, reinitiation downstream of an uORF of 105 nt is found
	to be just detectable, and increases markedly in efficiency as uORF
	length is reduced to 15 nt. Experiments using a strain mutated in

  abstract = {Owing to their rapid reproductive rate and the severe penalties for
	reduced fitness, diseases are under immense evolutionary pressure.
	Understanding the evolutionary response of diseases in new situations
	has clear public-health consequences, given the changes in social
	and movement patterns over recent decades and the increased use of
	antibiotics. This paper investigates how a disease may adapt in response
	to the routes of transmission available between infected and susceptible
	individuals. The potential transmission routes are defined by a computer-generated
	contact network, which we describe as either local (highly clustered
	networks where connected individuals are likely to share common contacts)
	or global (unclustered networks with a high proportion of long-range
	connections). Evolution towards stable strategies operates through
	the gradual random mutation of disease traits (transmission rate
	and infectious period) whenever new infections occur. In contrast
	to mean-field models, the use of contact networks greatly constrains

	genotyping for low-copy Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with
	polymorphic guanine-cytosine-rich repetitive sequence (PGRS) on epidemiologic
	inferences in population-based research settings. DESIGN: For San
	Francisco tuberculosis cases (1991-1996), clusters were defined by
	IS6110 alone and by PGRSlIS6110 to 1) estimate recent transmission,
	2) evaluate the theoretical influence of bacterial population parameters
	on these estimates, and 3) assess risk factors for recent transmission.
	RESULTS: Secondary typing on low-copy strains (20.3\% of all isolates)
	decreased the estimate of recent transmission from 29.1\% to 25.3\%
	(P = 0.03). The most influential parameters in determining whether
	supplemental genotyping results in different estimates were the proportion
	of low-copy strains and the amount of clustering. Risk factors for
	recent transmission were identical for both definitions of clustering.
	CONCLUSION: The statistical and inferred effects of sec ondary genotyping
	of M. tuberculosis seem to depend on the proportion of low-copy strains
	in the population, When this proportion is low or when few secondary
	patterns match, supplemental genotyping may yield minimal insight
	into population-level investigations. }

	species that show similar adult phenotypes but different underlying
	developmental patterns. To study such phenomena, I develop a model
	that follows evolution on a surface representing adult phenotype
	as a function of underlying developmental characters. A contour on
	such a "phenotype landscape" is a set of states of developmental
	characters that produce the same adult phenotype. Epistasis induces
	curvature of this surface, and degree of canalization is represented
	by the slope along a contour. I first discuss the geometric properties
	of phenotype landscapes, relating epistasis to canalization. I then
	impose a fitness function on the phenotype and model evolution of
	developmental characters as a function of the fitness function and
	the local geometry of the surface. This model shows how canalization
	evolves as a population approaches an optimum phenotype. It further
	shows that under some circumstances, "decanalization" can occur,
	in which the expression of adult phenotype becomes increasingly sensitive
	to developmental variation. This process can cause very similar populations
	to diverge from one another developmentally even when their adult

	used to evaluate the biochemical processes underlying experimentally
	determined changes in the monoterpene pathway under low ambient-light
	intensities, which led to an accumulation of the branchpoint intermediate
	(+)-pulegone and the side product (+)-menthofuran. Our simulations
	indicated that the environmentally regulated changes in monoterpene
	profiles could only be explained when, in addition to effects on
	biosynthetic enzyme activities, as yet unidentified inhibitory effects
	of (+)-menthofuran on the branchpoint enzyme pulegone reductase (PR)
	were assumed. Subsequent in vitro analyses with recombinant protein
	confirmed that (+)-menthofuran acts as a weak competitive inhibitor
	of PR (K(i) = 300 muM). To evaluate whether the intracellular concentration
	of (+)-menthofuran was high enough for PR inhibition in vivo, we
	isolated essential oil-synthesizing secretory cells from peppermint
	leaves and subjected them to steam distillations. When peppermint
	plants were grown under low-light conditions, (+)-menthofuran was
	selectively retained in secretory cells and accumulated to very high
	levels (up to 20 mM), whereas under regular growth conditions, (+)-menthofuran
	levels remained very low (<400 muM). These results illustrate the

	in the basic reproductive rate of infection. We also demonstrate

	By allowing a relatively general dependence structure among sites,

	To quantify the impact of protein structure on protein evolution,
	we analyze protein-coding DNA sequence pairs with an evolutionary
	model that incorporates effects of solvent accessibility and pairwise
	interactions among amino acid residues. By explicitly considering
	the relationship between nonsynonymous substitution rates and protein

	Analyses of lysozyme c and annexin V sequence pairs yield the biologically
	reasonable result that amino acid replacement rates are higher when
	the replacements lead to energetically favorable proteins than when
	they destabilize the proteins. Although the focus here is evolutionary
	dependence among codons that is associated with protein structure,

	of codon usage bias and {tRNA} content in the framework of translation
	optimization. Because most Studies have focused only on codon usage,
	we analyzed the {tRNA} gene pool of 102 bacterial species. We show
	that as minimal generation times get shorter, the genomes contain
	more {tRNA} genes, but fewer anticodon species. Surprisingly, despite
	the wide G+C variation of bacterial genomes these anticodons are
	the same in most genomes. This suggests an optimization of the translation
	machinery to use a small subset of optimal coclons and anticodons
	in fast-growing bacteria and in highly expressed genes. As a result,
	the overrepresented codons in highly expressed genes tend to be the
	same in very different genomes to match the same most-frequent anticodons.
	This is particularly important in fast-growing bacteria, which have
	higher codon usage bias in these genes. Three models were tested
	to understand the choice of coclons recognized by the same anticodons,
	all providing significant fit, but under different classes of genes
	and genomes. Thus, co-evolution of {tRNA} gene composition and codon
	usage bias in genomes seen from {tRNA}'s point of view agrees with
	the selection-mutation-drift theory. However, it Suggests a Much
	more universal trend in the evolution of anticodon and codon choice
	than previously thought. It also provides new evidence that a selective

	model for change in transposable element genotypes, obtaining maximum-likelihood
	estimators for various detection and monitoring schemes. The method
	is applied to serial genotypes of the transposon IS6110 in Mycobacterium
	tuberculosis. The estimated birth rate of 0.0161 (events per copy
	of the transposon per year) and death rate of 0.0108 are both significantly
	larger than the estimated shift rate of 0.0018. The sum of these
	estimates, which corresponds to a "half-life" of 2.4 years for a
	typical strain that has 10 copies of the element, substantially exceeds
	a previous estimate of 0.0135 total changes per copy per year. We
	consider experimental design issues that enable the precision of
	estimates to be improved. We also discuss extensions to other markers
	and implications for molecular epidemiology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

	level of gene expression from relative codon bias (RCB). There are
	a number of measures currently in use that quantify codon usage in
	genes. Based on the hypothesis that gene expressivity and codon composition
	is strongly correlated, RCB has been defined to provide an intuitively
	meaningful measure of an extent of the codon preference in a gene.
	We outline a simple approach to assess the strength of RCB (RCBS)
	in genes as a guide to their likely expression levels and illustrate
	this with an analysis of Escherichia coli (E. coli) genome. Our efforts
	to quantitatively predict gene expression levels in E. coli met with
	a high level of success. Surprisingly, we observe a strong correlation
	between RCBS and protein length indicating natural selection in favour
	of the shorter genes to be expressed at higher level. The agreement
	of our result with high protein abundances, microarray data and radioactive

  abstract = { ABSTRACT Darwin recognized that natural selection could not favor
	a trait in one species solely for the benefit of another species.
	The modern, selfishâ€gene view of the world suggests that cooperation
	between individuals, whether of the same species or different species,
	should be especially vulnerable to the evolution of noncooperators.
	Yet, cooperation is prevalent in nature both within and between species.
	What special circumstances or mechanisms thus favor cooperation?
	Currently, evolutionary biology offers a set of disparate explanations,
	and a general framework for this breadth of models has not emerged.
	Here, we offer a tripartite structure that links previously disconnected
	views of cooperation. We distinguish three general models by which
	cooperation can evolve and be maintained: (i) directed reciprocationâ€”cooperation
	with individuals who give in return; (ii) shared genesâ€”cooperation
	with relatives (e.g., kin selection); and (iii) byproduct benefitsâ€”cooperation
	as an incidental consequence of selfish action. Each general model
	is further subdivided. Several renowned examples of cooperation that
	have lacked explanation until recentlyâ€”plantâ€rhizobium symbioses
	and bacteriaâ€squid light organsâ€”fit squarely within this framework.
	Natural systems of cooperation often involve more than one model,
	and a fruitful direction for future research is to understand how
	these models interact to maintain cooperation in the long term. },

  abstract = {Parasitic protozoa are a major cause of global infectious disease.
	These eukaryotic pathogens have evolved with the vertebrate immune
	system and typically produce long-lasting chronic infections. A critical
	step in their host interaction is the evasion of innate immune defenses.
	The ability to avoid attack by humoral effector mechanisms, such
	as complement lysis, is of particular importance to extracellular
	parasites, whereas intracellular protozoa must resist killing by
	lysosomal enzymes and toxic metabolites. They do so by remodeling
	the phagosomal compartments in which they reside and by interfering
	with signaling pathways that lead to cellular activation. In addition,
	there is growing evidence that protozoan pathogens modify the antigen-presenting
	and immunoregulatory functions of dendritic cells, a process that
	facilitates their evasion of both innate and adaptive immunity.},

	Results: We developed a new 'interaction generality' measure (IG2)
	to assess the reliability of protein-protein interactions using only
	the topological properties of their interaction-network structure.
	Using yeast protein-protein interaction data, we showed that reliable
	protein-protein interactions had significantly lower IG2 values than
	less-reliable interactions, suggesting that IG2 values can be used
	to evaluate and filter interaction data to enable the construction
	of reliable protein-protein interaction networks.},

  abstract = {The suppression of stop codons (termed translational readthrough)
	can be caused by a decreased accuracy of translation elongation or
	a reduced efficiency of translation termination. In previous studies,
	the inability to determine the extent to which each of these distinct
	processes contributes to a readthrough phenotype has limited our
	ability to evaluate how defects in the translational machinery influence
	the overall termination process. Here, we describe the combined use
	of misincorporation and readthrough reporter systems to determine
	which of these mechanisms contributes to translational readthrough
	in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The misincorporation reporter system
	was generated by introducing a series of near-cognate mutations into
	functionally important residues in the firefly luciferase gene. These
	constructs allowed us to monitor the incidence of elongation errors
	by monitoring the level of firefly luciferase activity from a mutant
	allele inactivated by a single missense mutation. In this system,
	an increase in luciferase activity should reflect an increased level
	of misincorporation of the wild-type amino acid that provides an
	estimate of the overall fidelity of translation elongation. Surprisingly,
	we found that growth in the presence of paromomycin stimulated luciferase
	activity for only a small subset of the mutant proteins examined.
	This suggests that the ability of this aminoglycoside to induce elongation
	errors is limited to a subset of near-cognate mismatches. We also
	found that a similar bias in near-cognate misreading could be induced
	by the expression of a mutant form of ribosomal protein (r-protein)
	S9B or by depletion of r-protein L12. We used this misincorporation
	reporter in conjunction with a readthrough reporter system to show
	that alterations at different regions of the ribosome influence elongation
	fidelity and termination efficiency to different extents.},

	virulence and host resistance under a multilocus gene- for-gene interaction.
	The degrees of parasite virulence and host resistance show coevolutionary
	cycles for sufficiently small costs of virulence and resistance.
	Besides these coevolutionary cycles of a longer period, multilocus
	genotype frequencies show complex fluctuations over shorter periods.
	All multilocus genotypes are maintained within host and parasite
	classes having the same number of resistant/virulent alleles and
	their frequencies fluctuate with approximately equally displaced
	phases. If either the cost of virulence or the number of resistance
	loci is larger then a threshold, the host maintains the static polymorphism
	of singly (or doubly or more, depending on the cost of resistance)
	resistant genotypes and the parasite remains universally avirulent.
	In other words, host polymorphism can prevent the invasion of any
	virulent strain in the parasite. Thus, although assuming an empirically
	common type of asymmetrical gene-for-gene interaction, both host
	and parasite populations can maintain polymorphism in each locus
	and retain complex fluctuations. Implications for the red queen hypothesis

	This system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the genetic
	architecture of adaptation and speciation because floral traits that
	confer pollinator specificity also contribute to premating reproductive
	isolation. We asked: (i) What floral traits cause pollinator discrimination
	among plant species? and (ii) What is the genetic basis of these
	traits? We examined these questions by using data obtained from a
	large-scale field experiment where genetic markers were employed
	to determine the genetic basis of pollinator visitation. Observations
	of F2 hybrids produced by crossing bee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii
	with hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus cardinalis revealed that bees
	preferred large flowers low in anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments,
	whereas hummingbirds favored nectar-rich flowers high in anthocyanins.
	An allele that increases petal carotenoid concentration reduced bee
	visitation by 80\%, whereas an allele that increases nectar production
	doubled hummingbird visitation. These results suggest that genes
	of large effect on pollinator preference have contributed to floral
	evolution and premating reproductive isolation in these monkeyflowers.

  abstract = {The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a widely used model
	organism to study basic mechanisms of eukaryotic biology, but unlike
	other model organisms, its proteome remains largely uncharacterized.
	Using a shotgun proteomics approach based on multidimensional prefractionation
	and tandem mass spectrometry, we have detected similar to 30\% of
	the theoretical fission yeast proteome. Applying statistical modelling
	to normalize spectral counts to the number of predicted tryptic peptides,
	we have performed label-free quantification of 1465 proteins. The
	fission yeast protein data showed considerable correlations with
	{mRNA} levels and with the abundance of orthologous proteins in budding
	yeast. Functional pathway analysis indicated that the {mRNA} protein
	correlation is strong for proteins involved in signalling and metabolic
	processes, but increasingly discordant for components of protein
	complexes, which clustered in groups with similar {mRNA}-protein
	ratios. Self-organizing map clustering of large-scale protein and
	{mRNA} data from fission and budding yeast revealed coordinate but
	not always concordant expression of components of functional pathways
	and protein complexes. This finding reaffirms at the protein level
	the considerable divergence in gene expression patterns of the two
	model organisms that was noticed in previous transcriptomic studies.

  journal = {Reports On Progress In Physics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {69},
  pages = {1419-1477},
  abstract = {RNA secondary structures are derived from RNA sequences, which are
	strings built form the natural four letter nucleotide alphabet, {AUGC}.
	These coarse-grained structures, in turn, are tantamount to constrained
	strings over a three letter alphabet. Hence, the secondary structures
	are discrete objects and the number of sequences always exceeds the
	number of structures. The sequences built from two letter alphabets
	form perfect structures when the nucleotides can form a base pair,
	as is the case with {GC} or {AU}, but the relation between the sequences
	and structures differs strongly from the four letter alphabet. A
	comprehensive theory of RNA structure is presented, which is based
	on the concepts of sequence space and shape space, being a space
	of structures. It sets the stage for modelling processes in ensembles
	of RNA molecules like evolutionary optimization or kinetic folding
	as dynamical phenomena guided by mappings between the two spaces.
	The number of minimum free energy (mfe) structures is always smaller
	than the number of sequences, even for two letter alphabets. Folding
	of RNA molecules into mfe energy structures constitutes a non-invertible
	mapping from sequence space onto shape space. The preimage of a structure
	in sequence space is defined as its neutral network. Similarly the
	set of suboptimal structures is the preimage of a sequence in shape
	space. This set represents the conformation space of a given sequence.
	The evolutionary optimization of structures in populations is a process
	taking place in sequence space, whereas kinetic folding occurs in
	molecular ensembles that optimize free energy in conformation space.
	Efficient folding algorithms based on dynamic programming are available
	for the prediction of secondary structures for given sequences. The
	inverse problem, the computation of sequences for predefined structures,
	is an important tool for the design of RNA molecules with tailored
	properties. Simultaneous folding or cofolding of two or more RNA
	molecules can be modelled readily at the secondary structure level
	and allows prediction of the most stable (mfe) conformations of complexes
	together with suboptimal states. Cofolding algorithms are important
	tools for efficient and highly specific primer design in the polymerase
	chain reaction (PCR) and help to explain the mechanisms of small
	interference RNA (si-RNA) molecules in gene regulation. The evolutionary
	optimization of RNA structures is illustrated by the search for a
	target structure and mimics aptamer selection in evolutionary biotechnology.
	It occurs typically in steps consisting of short adaptive phases
	interrupted by long epochs of little or no obvious progress in optimization.
	During these quasi-stationary epochs the populations are essentially
	confined to neutral networks where they search for sequences that
	allow a continuation of the adaptive process. Modelling RNA evolution
	as a simultaneous process in sequence and shape space provides answers
	to questions of the optimal population size and mutation rates. Kinetic
	folding is a stochastic process in conformation space. Exact solutions
	are derived by direct simulation in the form of trajectory sampling
	or by solving the master equation. The exact solutions can be approximated
	straightforwardly by Arrhenius kinetics on barrier trees, which represent
	simplified versions of conformational energy landscapes. The existence
	of at least one sequence forming any arbitrarily chosen pair of structures
	is granted by the intersection theorem. Folding kinetics is the key
	to understanding and designing multistable RNA molecules or RNA switches.
	These RNAs form two or more long lived conformations, and conformational
	changes occur either spontaneously or are induced through binding
	of small molecules or other biopolymers. RNA switches are found in
	nature where they act as elements in genetic and metabolic regulation.
	The reliability of RNA secondary structure prediction is limited
	by the accuracy with which the empirical parameters can be determined
	and by principal deficiencies, for example by the lack of energy
	contributions resulting from tertiary interactions. In addition,
	native structures may be determined by folding kinetics rather than
	by thermodynamics. We address the first problem by considering base
	pair probabilities or base pairing entropies, which are derived from
	the partition function of conformations. A high base pair probability
	corresponding to a low pairing entropy is taken as an indicator of
	a high reliability of prediction. Pseudoknots are discussed as an
	example of a tertiary interaction that is highly important for RNA
	function. Moreover, pseudoknot formation is readily incorporated
	into structure prediction algorithms. Some examples of experimental
	data on RNA secondary structures that are readily explained using
	the landscape concept are presented. They deal with (i) properties
	of RNA molecules with random sequences, (ii) RNA molecules from restricted
	alphabets, (iii) existence of neutral networks, (iv) shape space
	covering, (v) riboswitches and (vi) evolution of noncoding RNAs as
	an example of evolution restricted to neutral networks. },

	ribosome entry site-like mRNA structure, and its efficiency is enhanced
	by the Kozak nucleotide context. Furthermore, ribosomes scan 5' to
	3' specifically for the CUG initiation codon in a eukaryotic translation
	initiation factor 2-independent manner. Because eukaryotic translation
	initiation factor 2 is frequently targeted to inhibit protein synthesis,

	researchers since the code was first discovered. One suggestion,
	which is the subject of this review, is that the code's organization
	is the outcome of the coevolution of genes and genetic codes. In
	1968, Francis Crick explored the possible implications of coevolution

	was likely to influence the evolution of the code, he concludes that
	it falls short of explaining the organization of the code we see

	of the first applications of these advances, other important aspects

	the translation of message into protein. Earlier we reported a high
	throughput technology for simultaneously studying {mRNA} level and
	translation, which we termed translation state array analysis, or
	TSAA. The current studies test the proposition that TSAA can identify
	novel instances of translation regulation at the genome-wide level.
	As a biological model, cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were
	cell cycle-arrested using either alpha-factor or the temperature-sensitive
	cdc15-2 allele. Forty-eight {mRNA}s were found to change significantly
	in translation state following release from a-factor arrest, including
	genes involved in pheromone response and cell cycle arrest such as
	BAR1, SST2, and FAR1. After the shift of the cdc15-2 strain from
	37 degreesC to 25 degreesC, 54 {mRNA}s were altered in translation
	state, including the products of the stress genes HSP82, HSC82, and
	SSA2. Thus, regulation at the translational level seems to play a
	significant role in the response of yeast cells to external physical
	or biological cues. In contrast, surprisingly few genes were found
	to be translationally controlled as cells progressed through the
	cell cycle. Additional refinements of TSAA should allow characterization
	of both transcriptional and translational regulatory networks on
	a genomic scale, providing an additional layer of information that
	can be integrated into models of system biology and function.},

	The first is generated by the invasion of opportunistic bacterial

	The second is generated by intracellular viruses, and accounts for

	It is thought that viruses acquire histo-blood group structures as

	(FPLV) or a closely related virus, differing at several key amino

	the emergence of CPV. Although FPLV has remained an endemic infection
	in its host populations, we show that, since the 1970s, the newly
	emerged CPV has undergone an epidemic-like pattern of logistic/exponential
	growth, effectively doubling its population size every few years.
	This rapid population growth was associated with a lineage of CPV
	that acquired a broader host range and greater infectivity. Recombination
	played no role in the emergence of CPV. Rather, any preexisting variation
	in the donor species and the subsequent rapid adaptation of the virus
	to canines were likely dependent on a high rate of mutation and the
	positive selection of mutations in the major capsid gene. Strikingly,
	although these single-stranded viruses have a DNA genome and use
	cellular replication machinery, their rate of nucleotide substitution

	patterns to identify proteome-wide characteristics indicative of
	trends common to expressed proteins. Results: Numerous bioinformatics
	methods were used to filter and merge information regarding gene
	and protein annotations. A new statistical time point-oriented analysis
	was developed for the study of dynamic correlations in large time
	series data. The method was applied to investigate microarray datasets

	B and T cell stimulation, Drosophila melanogaster life span, and
	Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. Conclusion: We show that the
	properties of proteins synthesized correlate dynamically with the
	gene expression profile, indicating that not only is the actual identity
	and function of expressed proteins important for cellular responses
	but that several physicochemical and other protein properties correlate
	with gene expression as well. Gene expression correlates strongly

	Thus, our results suggest that a dynamic relationship exists between

	In most of the common chromosome deletion/duplication syndromes,
	the rearranged genomic segments are flanked by large (usually >10
	kb), highly homologous low copy repeat (LCR) structures that can
	act as recombination substrates. Recombination between non-allelic
	LCR copies, also known as non-allelic homologous recombination, can
	result in deletion or duplication of the intervening segment. Recent
	findings suggest that other chromosomal rearrangements, including
	reciprocal, Robertsonian and jumping translocations, inversions,
	isochromosomes and small marker chromosomes, may also involve susceptibility
	to rearrangement related to genome structure or architecture. In
	several cases, LCRs, AT-rich palindromes and pericentromeric repeats
	are located at such rearrangement breakpoints. Analysis of the products

	homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining as causative

	a role not only in disease etiology, but also in primate genome evolution.
	In this review, we discuss recent advances regarding general mechanisms

  abstract = {HIV-1 is one of the fastest evolving entities known. Given that census
	population sizes of HIV-1 within individuals are much greater than
	the inverse mutation rate, every possible single point mutation in
	the viral genome occurs each generation. This enormous capability
	to generate genetic variation allows for escape from immune surveillance
	and antiviral therapy. However, compared to this potential, populations
	of HIV-1 within individuals exhibit little genetic variation. This
	discrepancy between the known mutation rate of HIV-1 and the average
	level of genetic variation in the env gene observed in vivo is reflected
	in comparisons of the actual numbers of productively infected cells,
	estimated as 10(7), and the effective population size, estimated
	as 10(3). Using approximate Bayesian computation, we evaluated several
	hypotheses based on a variety of selective and demographic processes
	to explain the low effective population size of HIV-1. Of the models
	we examined, the metapopulation model, in which HIV-1 evolves within
	an individual as a large collection of small subpopulations subject
	to frequent migration, extinction, and recolonization, was most consistent
	with the observed levels of genetic variation and the average frequencies
	of those variants. The metapopulation model links previous studies

	There were no temporal correlations in probability of movement, movement

	Bluehead chubs demonstrated complex relationships between probability

	effect of size on probability of movement. Further, growth of individual
	bluehead chubs was correlated through time. These empirical results
	suggest the hypothesis that heterogeneity in phenotypic attributes,

	behavior. A diffusion-advection model of bluehead chub movement,
	structured with two subgroups that dispersed at different rates ("fast

	the leptokurtic pattern observed in the field data, in contrast to
	the classic diffusion model without population heterogeneity, which
	produces a normal distribution. The results from this work suggest
	that heterogeneity in fitness-influencing attributes such as size

	carbon sources). We observed that most transcripts vary by strain
	and condition, with 2,996, 3,448, and 2,037 transcripts showing significant

	We expression profiled over 100 segregants derived from a cross between

	At the locus level, local linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms
	in cis-regulatory elements, tend to be more stable across conditions,
	such that they are more likely to show the same effect or the same
	direction of effect across conditions. Distant linkages, which usually
	correspond to polymorphisms influencing trans-acting factors, are
	more condition-dependent, and often show effects in different directions

	of the variation is explained by polymorphism in the gene IRA2. The
	RM allele of IRA2 appears to inhibit Ras/PKA signaling more strongly
	than the BY allele, and has undergone a change in selective pressure.
	Our results provide a broad overview of the genetic architecture
	of gene-environment interactions, as well as a detailed molecular
	example, and lead to key insights into how the effects of different

	Purification of recombinant thermostable proteins is essentially
	trivial since unwanted mesophilic host protein can efficiently be

	E. coli often results in truncated protein forms. In many cases,
	this is a consequence of abundant codons in heterologous genes, which

	for translational stalling and termination during protein biosynthesis.
	Other complications may originate from potential initiation codons
	and ribosomal binding sites present inside the open reading frame
	of the target gene or from other less well defined phenomena such
	as mRNA instability. Separation of full-length protein from truncated
	forms is a serious chromatographic problem that can be solved in

  abstract = {During primary HIV infection the viral load in plasma increases, reaches
	a peak, and then declines. Phillips has suggested that the decline
	is due to a limitation in the number of cells susceptible to HIV
	infection, while other authors have suggested that the decline in
	viremia is due to an immune response. Here we address this issue
	by developing models of primary HIV-1 infection, and by comparing
	predictions from these models with data from ten anti-retroviral,
	drug-naive, infected patients. Applying nonlinear least-squares estimation,
	we find that relatively small variations in parameters are capable
	of mimicking the highly diverse patterns found in patient viral load
	data. This approach yields an estimate of 2.5 days for the average
	lifespan of productively infected cells during primary infection,
	a Value that is consistent with results obtained by drug perturbation
	experiments. We find that the data from all ten patients are consistent
	with a target-cell-limited model from the time of initial infection
	until shortly after the peak in viremia. However, the kinetics of
	the subsequent fall and recovery in virus concentration in some patients
	are not consistent with the predictions of the target-cell-limited
	model. We illustrate that two possible immune response mechanisms,
	cytotoxic T lymphocyte destruction of infected target cells and cytokine
	suppression of viral replication, could account for declines in viral
	load data not predicted by the original target-cell-limited model.
	We conclude that some additional process, perhaps mediated by CD8
	+ T cells, is important in at least some patients. (C) 2000 Academic

	In a triplet-based genetic code there are three potential forward

	(frameshift errors) occur less frequently than sense errors, although

	The average error frequency of misincorporation of histidine at this

	x 10(-5) and this frequency was increased some 50-fold by growth
	in the presence of paromomycin, a known translational-error-inducing

  abstract = {This paper illustrates the utility of applying evolutionary thought
	to medical issues with three examples: selection arenas, aging, and
	tradeoffs. First, the human female reproductive tract functions as
	a selection arena at two levels: in the ovaries, where atresia reduces
	14 the number of oocytes by more than 99.99\% before any are ovulated,
	and in the uterus, where early embryos homozygous for immune genes
	are spontaneously aborted. These selective filters early in life
	have implications both for eugenics and for the anti-abortion movement.
	Second, the evolutionary theory of aging predicts that intrinsic
	mortality should reflect extrinsic mortality: if life for adults
	is risky, then it does not pay to invest in maintenance at the expense
	of reproduction. This idea is well confirmed, at least in populations
	where density effects are not important. While only organisms that
	reproduce asymmetrically should age, even bacteria reproduce asymmetrically,
	and they do age, suggesting that all organisms reproduce asymmetrically
	and therefore age. Third, tradeoffs are central to theories of phenotypic
	design, but the mechanisms that cause them remain obscure. A method
	is suggested to get at the mechanisms of tradeoffs by examining conflicts
	among functions over gene expression. It could be applied in humans
	to the tradeoff between reproductive performance and disease resistance.

	level, cis-regulatory mutations altering morphology are more common
	than coding changes. Also, above the species level cis-regulatory

  abstract = {In many organisms, selection acts on synonymous codons to improve
	translation. However, the precise basis of this selection remains
	unclear in the majority of species. Selection could be acting to
	maximize the speed of elongation, to minimize the costs of proofreading,
	or to maximize the accuracy of translation. Using several data sets,
	we find evidence that codon use in \emph{Escherichia coli} is biased
	to reduce the costs of both missense and nonsense translational errors.
	Highly conserved sites and genes have higher codon bias than less
	conserved ones, and codon bias is positively correlated to gene length
	and production costs, both indicating selection against missense
	errors. Additionally, codon bias increases along the length of genes,
	indicating selection against nonsense errors. Doublet mutations or
	replacement substitutions do not explain our observations. The correlations
	remain when we control for expression level and for conflicting selection
	pressures at the start and end of genes. Considering each amino acid
	by itself confirms our results. We conclude that selection on synonymous
	codon use in E. coli is largely due to selection for translational
	accuracy, to reduce the costs of both missense and nonsense errors.

  abstract = {Entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae)
	are lethal obligatory parasites of insects and are found in soils
	throughout the world. The recognition that these nematodes are major
	natural enemies of soil insect pests has stimulated research into
	various aspects of their biology and enabled their use in augmentation
	and conservation biological control programs. Unfortunately, relatively
	little is known about the structure and dynamics of their populations
	or the factors that influence them. This knowledge is required if
	these nematodes are to fulfill their considerable potential as manageable
	components of cultivated ecosystems. The unusual life history of
	entomopathogenic nematodes imposes important constraints on their
	population biology. The host cadaver serves as the focus for many
	of the fundamental interactions associated with their population
	dynamics because feeding, development, mating, and reproduction are
	confined to the cadaver environment. Only non-feeding infective juveniles
	(dauer larvae) leave the host, but their production, dispersal, persistence,
	and infection potential provide critical links for the survival and
	proliferation of populations. Infective juveniles also carry symbiotic
	bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) that are released within the host,
	are largely responsible for host death, and form an integral part
	of their life history. In this paper, we discuss the structure of
	entomopathogenic nematode populations, the various biotic and abiotic
	factors that influence them, and procedures for sampling and modeling
	their spatial and temporal dynamics. Environmental degradation and
	the economic and social realities of modern agriculture assure that
	entomopathogenic nematodes will remain prime subjects for continuing

  title = {Comparison of codon usage measures and their applicability in prediction

  journal = {Bmc Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Background: There are a number of methods (also called: measures)
	currently in use that quantify codon usage in genes. These measures
	are often influenced by other sequence properties, such as length.
	This can introduce strong methodological bias into measurements;
	therefore we attempted to develop a method free from such dependencies.
	One of the common applications of codon usage analyses is to quantitatively
	predict gene expressivity. Results: We compared the performance of
	several commonly used measures and a novel method we introduce in
	this paper - Measure Independent of Length and Composition (MILC).
	Large, randomly generated sequence sets were used to test for dependence
	on (i) sequence length, (ii) overall amount of codon bias and (iii)
	codon bias discrepancy in the sequences. A derivative of the method,
	named MELP (MILC-based Expression Level Predictor) can be used to
	quantitatively predict gene expression levels from genomic data.
	It was compared to other similar predictors by examining their correlation
	with actual, experimentally obtained {mRNA} or protein abundances.
	Conclusion: We have established that MILC is a generally applicable
	measure, being resistant to changes in gene length and overall nucleotide
	composition, and introducing little noise into measurements. Other
	methods, however, may also be appropriate in certain applications.
	Our efforts to quantitatively predict gene expression levels in several
	prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes met with varying levels of
	success, depending on the experimental dataset and predictor used.
	Out of all methods, MELP and Rainer Merkl's GCB method had the most
	consistent behaviour. A 'reference set' containing known ribosomal
	protein genes appears to be a valid starting point for a codon usage-based
	expressivity prediction. },

	presents three lines of evidence supporting the action of positive
	selection on M. tuberculosis within patients. The arguments are based
	on a comparison between empirical findings from molecular epidemiology,
	and population genetic models of evolution. Under the hypothesis
	of neutrality of genotypes, 1) the mutation rate of the marker IS6110
	is unusually high, 2) the time it takes for substitutions to occur
	within patients is too short, and 3) the amount of polymorphism within
	patients is too low. Conclusions: Empirical observations are explained
	by the action of positive selection during infection, or alternatively
	by very low effective population sizes. I discuss the possible roles

	suffer an indirect selective disadvantage; at the same time, bacteria
	carrying them can increase in frequency only by generating beneficial
	mutations at other loci. When clone, carrying imitator genes are
	rare, however, these beneficial mutations are far more likely to

	a model of the population dynamics of bacteria confronted with ever-changing

	the process by which initially rare mutator alleles can rise in frequency.
	We demonstrate that subsequent to a shift in environmental conditions,
	there will be relatively long periods of time during which the mutator
	subpopulation can produce a beneficial mutation before the ancestral
	subpopulations are eliminated. If the beneficial mutation arises
	early enough, the overall frequency of mutators will climb to a point
	higher than when the process began. The probability of producing
	a subsequent beneficial mutation will then also increase. In this

	properties: (1) K-h usually accounts for 25\%-30\% of total amino
	acid changes and (2) when the observed number of amino acid substitutions
	is large, K-h is predictably twice the value of K-a.. This shall
	be referred to as the twofold approximation. The new method for estimating
	Kh is applied to the comparisons between human and macaque and between
	mouse and rat. The twofold approximation holds well in these data
	sets, and the signature of positive selection can be more easily
	discerned using the K-h statistic than using K-a. Many genes with
	Ka/K-s > 0.5 can now be shown to have K-h/K-s > 1 and to have evolved
	adaptively, at least for the high-exchangeability group of amino

	Three examples of pathogens that are current causes for human health

	acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Pathogens directly

	genetics methods of partitioning variation of a trait into heritability
	and other components has very limited power to show anything clear
	and useful about genetic and environmental influences, especially
	for human behaviors and other traits. The first two gaps should be
	kept open; the others should be bridged or the difficulty of doing
	so should be acknowledged: 1. Key terms have multiple meanings that
	are distinct; 2. Statistical patterns are distinct from measurable
	underlying factors; 3. Translation from statistical analyses to hypotheses
	about measurable factors is difficult; 4. Predictions based on extrapolations
	from existing patterns of variation may not match outcomes; 5. The
	partitioning of variation in human studies does not reliably estimate
	the intended quantities; 6. Translation from statistical analyses
	to hypotheses about the measurable factors is even more difficult
	in light of the possible heterogeneity of underlying genetic or environmental
	factors; 7. Many steps lie between the analysis of observed traits
	and interventions based on well-founded claims about the causal influence
	of genetic or environmental factors; 8. Explanation of variation
	within groups does not translate to explanation of differences among
	groups. At the start, I engage readers' attention with three puzzles
	that have not been resolved by past debates. The puzzles concern
	generational increases in IQ test scores, the possibility of underlying
	heterogeneity, and the translation of methods from selective breeding
	into human genetics. After discussing the gaps, I present each puzzle
	in a new light and point to several new puzzles that invite attention
	from analysts of variation in quantitative genetics and in social
	science more generally. The article's critical perspectives on agricultural,
	laboratory, and human heritability studies are intended to elicit
	further contributions from readers across the fields of history,
	philosophy, sociology, and politics of biology and in the sciences.},

	studies, use confounding and ascertainment bias to help identify
	weak etiologic signal due to genes, since gene mapping is fundamentally
	a hypothesis-free science. This strategy makes it possible to identify
	genetic risk factors, but makes it impossible to quantify the size

	are of minimal value for gene identification, but may be of use in

	of skc gene such as +2,+3,+5,+8,+9 and +11. The results revealed
	that at +2 position "AGG" aided overexpression while shifting to
	+3 and +5 positions it rendered nil expression. In contrary, shifting
	of AGG codon to later positions like +9 and +11 the inhibitory effect
	was reversed and resulted in over-expression. The effect of 'AGG'

  abstract = {Anthelmintic resistance has become an increasing problem particularly
	to gastrointestinal tract nematodes and appropriate methods are required
	to detect this phenomenon so the correct action can be taken. This
	paper compares a number of mathematical techniques that are used
	to analyse data. The negative binomial distribution is a mathematical
	distribution used to model aggregated data and hence is suitable
	to model the intensity of parasite burden and the magnitude of the
	faecal egg counts. Maximum likelihood techniques are utilised to
	exploit this mathematical distribution to analyse the magnitude of
	the faecal egg count reduction and decline in the worm burden in
	response to anthelmintic treatment. Data from experimental groups
	of sheep described in the accompanying paper are used. In addition,
	simulated data sets of faecal egg counts were created using a random
	number generator following appropriate negative binomial distributions.
	The results demonstrate this statistical model can detect evidence
	of anthelmintic resistance with a faecal egg reduction test that
	otherwise might require a slaughter trial to demonstrate. In addition,
	the simulated data sets confirm that there is a significant probability
	of failure to detect low anthelmintic efficacy with commonly used
	mathematical techniques. Consequently, the use of maximum likelihood
	mathematical techniques with a negative binomial statistical model
	would aid in the early detection of anthelmintic resistance using
	faecal egg count reductions and result in a lower probability of
	inappropriately assigning an anthelmintic as effective. (c) 2004

	examine the occurrence of frameshifting and understand its mechanism

	We show that this phenomenon results from ribosomal slippage to the

	may enhance polyglutamine-associated toxicity, possibly contributing
	to pathogenesis. Finally, we present evidence that anisomycin, a

	(including gene-based therapy) in the present and in the future.
	BACKGROUND: Following almost a year of national debate, the Icelandic
	parliament passed the Health Sector Database (HSD) Act in 1998. No
	single issue has been as much debated in Iceland as this database.
	Despite the explosion of popular and scientific literature in the
	field of bioethics, there is still a paucity of research concerning
	'lay' contributions to the debates. METHODS: The study was designed
	as a qualitative study. Focus groups (FGs) were conducted followed
	by one-on-one interviews with the FG moderator. Participants were
	asked to comment on a future scenario consisting of predictions concerning
	the consequence of the Human Genome Project over the next 40 years.
	Participants: Forty-two persons participated in eight FGs in Iceland.
	The Icelandic moderator was interviewed in English after each group.
	CONCLUSIONS: The lay public was relatively optimistic with regard
	to the future of drugs and gene-based therapy. Reasons for this optimism
	can be found in a basic trust and belief in the welfare state and
	the health system. These results are not consistent with studies
	carried out in other countries where the public appears to be focused
	on the negative effects of genetic research and the threats to privacy.
	Most participants expressed concern about potential problems with
	regard to social and equity issues, whereas the HSD controversy,
	a discourse based on the rhetoric of bioethics, was at variance with
	the issues focused on by the lay public.},

  abstract = {Most microbes have complex life cycles with multiple modes of reproduction
	that differ in their effects on DNA sequence variation. Population
	genomic analyses can therefore be used to estimate the relative frequencies
	of these different modes in nature. The life cycle of the wild yeast
	Saccharomyces paradoxus is complex, including clonal reproduction,
	outcrossing, and two different modes of inbreeding. To quantify these
	different aspects we analyzed DNA sequence variation in the third
	chromosome among 20 isolates from two populations. Measures of mutational
	and recombinational diversity were used to make two independent estimates
	of the population size. In an obligately sexual population these
	values should be approximately equal. Instead there is a discrepancy
	of about three orders of magnitude between our two estimates of population
	size, indicating that S. paradoxus goes through a sexual cycle approximately
	once in every 1,000 asexual generations. Chromosome III also contains
	the mating type locus (MAT), which is the most outbred part in the
	entire genome, and by comparing recombinational diversity as a function
	of distance from MAT we estimate the frequency of matings to be approximate
	to 94\% from within the same tetrad, 5\% with a clonemate after switching
	the mating type, and 1\% outcrossed. Our study illustrates the utility
	of population genomic data in quantifying life cycles. },

	similar trapped states may be due to swapping of (fairly symmetric)
	segments. Domain swapping is more likely in the no-pause case in

	expected to lessen the chances of swapping events. Here, we review

	The patterns associated with selectively driven codon bias are weakly

	problem is easily identified, but for generalized linear models and
	for Cox regression models the situation is more complicated. An approximately
	equivalent two-sample problem may, however, also be identified here.
	In particular, we show that for logistic regression and Cox regression
	models the equivalent two-sample problem is obtained by selecting
	two equally sized samples for which the parameters differ by a value
	equal to the slope times twice the standard deviation of the independent
	variable and further requiring that the overall expected number of
	events is unchanged. In a simulation study we examine the validity
	of this approach to power calculations in logistic regression and
	Cox regression models. Several different covariate distributions
	are considered for selected values of the overall response probability
	and a range of alternatives. For the Cox regression model we consider
	both constant and non-constant hazard rates. The results show that
	in general the approach is remarkably accurate even in relatively
	small samples. Some discrepancies are, however, found in small samples
	with few events and a highly skewed covariate distribution. Comparison
	with results based on alternative methods for logistic regression
	models with a single continuous covariate indicates that the proposed
	method is at least as good as its competitors. The method is easy
	to implement and therefore provides a simple way to extend the range
	of problems that can be covered by the usual formulas for power and
	sample size determination. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}

	We conclude that spatial pattern formation in contact networks can

  abstract = {An ''adaptive dynamics'' modelling approach to the evolution of dominance-recessivity

	ecological scenario, and both evolutionary attractivity and invasibility
	of resident populations are examined. The ecology consists of a within-individual
	part representing a locus with regulated activity and a between-individual
	part that is a two-patch soft selection model. Evolutionary freedom
	is allowed at a single locus. The evolutionary analysis considers
	directed random walks on trait space, generated by repeated invasions
	of mutants. the phenotype of an individual is determined by allelic
	parameters. Mutations can have two effects: they either affect the
	affinity of the promoter sequence for transcription factors, or they
	affect the gene product. The dominance interaction between alleles
	derives from their promoter affinities. Additive genetics is evolutionarily
	unstable when selection and evolution maintain two alleles in the
	population. In such a situation, dominance interactions can become
	stationary and close to additive genetics or they continue to evolve
	at a very slow pace towards dominance-recessivity. The probability
	that a specific dominance interaction will evolve depends on the
	relative mutation rate of promoter compared to gene product and the
	distribution of mutational effect sizes. Either allele in the dimorphism
	can become dominant, and dominance-recessivity is always most likely
	to evolve. Evolution then approaches a population state where every
	phenotype has maximum viability in one of the two patches. When the
	within-individual part is replaced by a housekeeping locus that codes
	for a metabolic enzyme, evolution favours a population of two alleles
	under the same conditions as for a regulated locus. In the case of
	a housekeeping gene, however, the evolutionary dynamical system approaches
	a population state where the heterozygote and only one homozygote
	phenotype are equivalent to the optimum phenotypes in the two patches.

  abstract = {Over the past decade there has been a revolution in the understanding

	syndrome (HIV/AIDS)-associated disease. Much of this progress stems
	from a broader recognition of the importance of differences in viral
	types, including receptor preference(s), replication properties,
	and reservoirs, as contributing factors to immunosuppresion and disease
	progression. In contrast, there is limited conceptualizatin of viral
	diversity and turnover in the brain and circulation in relation to
	neurocognitive impairments. Herein, the authors review current concepts
	regarding viral molecular diversity and phenotypes together with
	features of HIV-1 neuroinvasion, neurotropism, neurovirulence, and
	neurosusceptiblity. Viral genetic and antigenic diversity is reduced
	within the brain compared to blood or other systemic organs within
	individuals. Conversely, viral molecular heterogeneity is greater
	in patients with HIV-associated dementia compared to nondemented
	patients, depending on the viral gene examined. Individual viral
	proteins exert multiple neuropathogenic effects, although the neurological
	consequences of different viral polymorphisms remain uncertain. Nonetheless,
	host genetic polymorphisms clearly influence neurological disease
	outcomes and likely dictate both acquired and innate immune responses,
	which in turn shape viral evolution within the host. Emerging issues
	include widespread antiretroviral therapy resistance and increasing
	awareness of viral superinfections together with viral recombination,
	all of which are likely to impact on both HIV genetic variation and
	neuropathogenesis. With the increasing prevalence of HIV-induced

  journal = {Nature},

  volume = {439},
  pages = {344-348},
  abstract = {An RNA virus population does not consist of a single genotype; rather,
	it is an ensemble of related sequences, termed quasispecies(1-4).
	Quasispecies arise from rapid genomic evolution powered by the high
	mutation rate of RNA viral replication(5-8). Although a high mutation
	rate is dangerous for a virus because it results in nonviable individuals,
	it has been hypothesized that high mutation rates create a 'cloud'
	of potentially beneficial mutations at the population level, which
	afford the viral quasispecies a greater probability to evolve and
	adapt to new environments and challenges during infection(4,9-11).
	Mathematical models predict that viral quasispecies are not simply
	a collection of diverse mutants but a group of interactive variants,
	which together contribute to the characteristics of the population(4,12).
	According to this view, viral populations, rather than individual
	variants, are the target of evolutionary selection(4,12). Here we
	test this hypothesis by examining the consequences of limiting genomic
	diversity on viral populations. We find that poliovirus carrying
	a high-fidelity polymerase replicates at wild-type levels but generates
	less genomic diversity and is unable to adapt to adverse growth conditions.
	In infected animals, the reduced viral diversity leads to loss of
	neurotropism and an attenuated pathogenic phenotype. Notably, using
	chemical mutagenesis to expand quasispecies diversity of the high-fidelity
	virus before infection restores neurotropism and pathogenesis. Analysis
	of viruses isolated from brain provides direct evidence for complementation
	between members in the quasispecies, indicating that selection indeed
	occurs at the population level rather than on individual variants.
	Our study provides direct evidence for a fundamental prediction of
	the quasispecies theory and establishes a link between mutation rate,
	population dynamics and pathogenesis. }

	cause subnormal courtship of Drosophila males toward females and
	courtship among males when driving a conditional disrupter of synaptic
	transmission (shi(TS)). We extended these manipulations to analyze
	all features of male-specific behavior, including courtship song,
	which was almost eliminated by driving shi(TS) at high temperature.
	In the context of singing defects and homosexual courtship affected
	by mutations in the fru gene, a tra-regulated component of the sex-determination
	hierarchy, we found a C309/tra(F) combination also to induce high
	levels of courtship between pairs of males and "chaining" behavior
	in groups; however, these doubly transgenic males sang normally.
	Because production of male-specific FRU(M) protein is regulated by
	TRA, we hypothesized that a fru-derived transgene encoding the male
	(M) form of an Inhibitory RNA (fru(MIR)) would mimic the effects
	of tra(F); but C309/fru(MIR) males exhibited no courtship chaining,
	although they courted other males in single-pair tests. Double-labeling
	of neurons in which GFP was driven by C309 revealed that 10 of the
	20 CNS clusters containing FRU(M) in wild-type males included coexpressing
	neurons. Histological analysis of the developing CNS could not rationalize
	the absence of tra(F) or fru(MIR) effects on courtship song, because
	we found C309 to be coexpressed with FRU(M) within the same 10 neuronal
	clusters in pupae. Thus, we hypothesize that elimination of singing
	behavior by the C309/shi(TS) combination involves neurons acting
	downstream of FRU(M) cells.},

	Here we describe the within-host dynamics of 3 spore-types of O.

	vertically. In all treatments the number of spores increased exponentially
	until spore density reached a plateau, suggesting density-dependent
	within-host growth. The spore types seen differ in their growth dynamics,
	suggesting different roles in the parasite life-cycle. Horizontally-infected
	hosts harboured significantly fewer spores than vertically-infected
	hosts. Further, host survival was affected by infection route, with

  journal = {Journal of Theoretical Biology},
  abstract = {"A continuum of alleles model with pair-wise A x A epistasis is proposed
	and its transmission genetic, and variational properties are analysed.
	The basic idea is that genes control the values of underlying variables,
	which affect the genotypic value of phenotypic characters proportional
	to a "scaling factor". Epistasis is the influence of one gene on
	the average effect of another gene. In this model, epistasis is introduced
	as a mutational effect of one gene on the scaling factors of another
	gene. In accordance with empirical results, the model assumes that
	the average direct effect of mutations is zero, as is the average
	epistatic effect. The model predicts that, on average, a mutation
	at one locus increases the expected mutational variance of mutations
	at another interacting locus. The increase in mutational variance
	is predicted to be equal to the variance of the pair-wise epistatic
	effects. This result is consistent with the observation that mutant
	phenotypes tend to be more variable than the wildtype phenotype.
	Another generic result of this model is that the frequency of canalizing
	mutations can at most be equal to the frequency of decanalizing mutations.
	Furthermore, it is predicted that the mutational variance of a character
	increases at least linearly with the size of the character; hence
	this model is scale variant. In the case of two characters it is
	shown that the dimensionality of the locus-specific mutational effect
	distribution is invariant, i.e. the rank of the mutational covariance
	matrix M is invariant. While in additive models the mutational covariance
	matrix is always and entirely invariant, the invariance in the case
	of epistatic models is unexpected. Epistatic interactions can change
	the magnitude of the mutational (co)variances at a locus and can
	thus influence the structure of the mutational covariance matrix.
	However, in the present model the dimensionality of the mutational
	effect distribution remains the same. A consequence of this result
	is that, in this model, the genetic architecture of a set of characters
	is always evolvable i.e. no hard constraints can evolve"}

	variation b/w mammalian hosts which leads to variation in resistance
	and susceptibility. Apparently immunogeneticists classify genes in
	two ways, MHC related and background genes (i.e. non-MHC). Many components
	to mammalian immune response against parasites, "Many oof these response
	may have no, or only marginal, activity against the targe parasite;
	some may be detrimental to the host; brobably only a few constitute
	the majore effectors of resistance." So it seems like there are lots
	of weapons in general, but in each case only a few are effective
	against any given parasite. Variation in the ability of these effective
	ones b/w hosts equals variation in host resistance. MHC related genes
	appear to be those that determine which epitopes are presented and
	how and the recognition genes on the T-cells for the epitopes but
	barring major mutational problems, "variations in resistance, suscept.
	and immunopathology more often reflect the activities of background
	genes\ldots[which] regulate all immunological and inflammatory cell
	pop., determining their devel. and freq. and controlling their productionof
	receptors and mediators." Major points about genes and Ir \begin{enumerate}

	by the capacity of hte host to control this replication." 1. Malaria:
	First level of immunity related to polymorphs related to target red-cells
	that affect parasite's ability to invade or develop. MHC appears
	to have little influence b/c in general there is substantial var.
	b/w parasites and lots of potential epitopes. Antibody titer and
	Tcell mediated responses may be important 2. Leishmania: Infects
	macrophages, apparently. Lots of variation in responses to parasite
	which lead to variation in disease responses. MHC and background
	genes are involved. Susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis has
	been linked to a single gene Lsh (in mouse?) and appears to also
	control suscept. to natural mouse parasitic spp. of Samonella and
	Mycobacterium. Lsh is related to macrophage's suitability for intracellular
	pathogens. Other genes have also been identified for controlling
	infection of other Leishmania spp. 3. Intestinal Protozoa: "Among
	the most common of all infections\ldots" Genetic variation in mice
	has been detected for suscp. to a number of different spp. including
	Giardia and Eimeria. Variation for Giardia related to ability to
	fully clear infection or if it lingers. May be related to IgA deficiency.
	B. Helminths: larger than most protozoan parasite targets, therefore,
	require other aspects of IR to clear. Also have protective surface
	layer and may be located in different parts of organism which "\ldots
	may circumscribe the mech. that are otherewise able to exert deleterious
	effects" of the IR on the parasite. 1. Schistosomes: Lots of variation
	in load b/w hosts w/ equal levels of exposure. IgE responses seem
	to be important in reisstnace. Apparently this may be the result
	of a "well est." trade-off b/w IgE and IgG$_4$ production which is
	determined by " the balance of active T cell subsets and their assoc.
	cytokine profiles. One possibility is, therefore, that suscp. individuals
	are progreammed to prodeuce the 'wrong' antibody responses can, in
	fact, block protective immune mech. and maintain chronic infection
	in the host." 2. Tapeworms: Variation in mice to est. of larval Taenia
	teniaeformis is " now known to be expressed through background genes
	that regulate the speed at whidch antiparasite antibody is produced.
	In rapid responders complement-fixing antibodies become avalilable
	before the larval worms develop an effective anticomplementary activity."
	Talks about a study of a natural pop. of deer mice and adult tapeworms.
	Distn. across hosts was highly aggregated and apparently due to a
	single gene which was due to a single dominant resist allele. Mech
	behind resistance is unknown. Research group headed by Wassom (70s

	in hosts could be due to gen. var. observed in lab. Several spp.
	"reach intestine afeter pereneral migrations (e.g. Ascaris, hookworms,
	\ldots) antiworm [antibody] responses can act against theses migrating
	stages, particularly during reinfections." Lots of different aspects
	of IR can become involved. Ab "may play an import. role against a
	number of gastro. nematodes. The binidng o fthe antibody to target
	molec. present ont the cuticle and intest. epithelium... can interfere

	"nematodes elicit strong IgE responses, and this isotype has long
	been implicated in protect. immunity through its involvement in immediate
	hypersensitivity reactions\ldots" Both MHC and background genes are
	important. 4. Filarial nematodes: Apperently family of nematodes
	that are transmitted via arthropod vectors. Lots of var. in humans
	to suscept. "Infective larvae seem to be import. targests of IR leading
	to resist., whereas responses directed against adult and microfilarial
	stages may lead to pathology." C. Arthropods: V. Conclusion: "The
	realization that relatively few genes exert bilogocially significant
	effects on host resistance makes it possible to see that evolutionary
	change in the balance of a relationship can occur as a result of
	small alterations in parasite or host activity." It seems that for
	each case of resistance or suscept. only a few genes are involved.
	These are the key potential weak links in the system and my guess
	is that which links are the weak ones may shift over time as the
	host-evolves and counter evolves or, if there is constrain on the
	host, would be static reaching a stable polymorphism. Now there's
	a good question. If the key genes shift then it would appear that
	the red queen hypoth. could apply for maint. of sex and other things,
	but if they don't, then it doesn't apply. Are there empirical systems
	in which this could be tested? Bacterial-phage would be ideal, in
	some sense, but they may lack the required complexity? It seems like
	to get links to shift noticably you need a long chain (i.e. a complex
	IR response), but if this were true, then that means r.q. would apply
	more to org. with complex IR (which are assumedly longer living org.).
	Imagine two scenarios: one where the suscept/resist of the h-p interaction
	is always centered at one place (e.g. initial Ab recog) such as influenza
	virus variation b/w years vs. a system where the determinant of s/r
	changes over time. One would be driven by var. in parasite, perhaps,
	the other, var. in host that the parasite then evolves to exploit.

  pages = {2755-2762},
  abstract = {In Drosophila melanogaster, synonymous codons corresponding to the
	most abundant cognate {tRNA}s are used more frequently, especially
	in highly expressed genes. Increased use of such "optimal" codons
	is considered an adaptation for translational efficiency. Need it
	always be the case that selection should favor the use of a translationally
	optimal codon? Here, we investigate one possible confounding factor,
	namely, the need to specify information in exons necessary to enable
	correct splicing. As expected from such a model, in Drosophila many
	codons show different usage near intron-exon boundaries versus exon
	core regions. However, this finding is in principle also consistent
	with Hill-Robertson effects modulating usage of translationally optimal
	codons. However, several results support the splice model over the
	translational selection model: 1) the trends in codon usage are strikingly
	similar to those in mammals in which codon usage near boundaries
	correlates with abundance in exonic splice enhancers (ESEs), 2) codons
	preferred near boundaries tend to be enriched for A and avoid C (conversely
	those avoided near boundaries prefer C rather than A), as expected
	were ESEs involved, and 3) codons preferred near boundaries are typically
	not translationally optimal. We conclude that usage of translationally
	optimal codons usage is compromised in the vicinity of splice junctions
	in intron-containing genes, to the effect that we observe higher
	levels of usage of translationally optimal codons at the center of
	exons. On the gene level, however, controlling for known correlates
	of codon bias, the impact on codon usage patterns is quantitatively
	small. These results have implications for inferring aspects of the

  journal = {{PLoS} Genetics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {4},
  abstract = {Coding sequence evolution was once thought to be the result of selection
	on optimal protein function alone. Selection can, however, also act
	at the RNA level, for example, to facilitate rapid translation or
	ensure correct splicing. Here, we ask whether the way DNA works also
	imposes constraints on coding sequence evolution. We identify nucleosome
	positioning as a likely candidate to set up such a DNA-level selective
	regime and use high-resolution microarray data in yeast to compare
	the evolution of coding sequence bound to or free from nucleosomes.
	Controlling for gene expression and intra-gene location, we find
	a nucleosome-free "clinker" sequence to evolve on average 5-6\% slower
	at synonymous sites. A reduced rate of evolution in linker is especially
	evident at the 5' end of genes, where the effect extends to non-synonymous
	substitution rates. This is consistent with regular nucleosome architecture
	in this region being important in the context of gene expression
	control. As predicted, codons likely to generate a sequence unfavourable
	to nucleosome formation are enriched in linker sequence. Amino acid
	content is likewise skewed as a function of nucleosome occupancy.
	We conclude that selection operating on DNA to maintain correct positioning
	of nucleosomes impacts codon choice, amino acid choice, and synonymous
	and non-synonymous rates of evolution in coding sequence. The results
	support the exclusion model for nucleosome positioning and provide
	an alternative interpretation for runs of rare codons. As the intimate
	association of histones and DNA is a universal characteristic of
	genic sequence in eukaryotes, selection on coding sequence composition
	imposed by nucleosome positioning should be phylogenetically widespread.},

  year = {2006},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Background: Despite a strong evolutionary pressure to reduce genome
	size, proteins vary in length over a surprisingly wide range also
	in very compact genomes. Here we investigated the evolutionary forces
	that act on protein size in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizing
	a system-wide bioinformatics approach. Data on yeast protein size
	was compared to global experimental data on protein expression, phenotypic
	pleiotropy, protein-protein interactions, protein evolutionary rate
	and biochemical classification. Results: Comparing the experimentally
	determined abundance of individual proteins, highly expressed proteins
	were found to be consistently smaller than lowly expressed proteins,
	in accordance with the biosynthetic cost minimization hypothesis.
	Yeast proteins able to maintain a high expression level despite a
	large size tended to belong to a very distinct set of protein families,
	notably nuclear transport and translation initiation/elongation.
	Large proteins have significantly more protein-protein interactions
	than small proteins, suggesting that a requirement for multiple interaction
	domains may constitute a positive selective pressure for large protein
	size in yeast. The higher frequency of proteinprotein interactions
	in large proteins was not accompanied by a higher phenotypic pleiotropy.
	Hence, the increase in interactions may not reflect an increase in
	function differentiation. Proteins of different sizes also evolved
	at similar rates. Finally, whereas the biological process involved
	was found to have little influence on protein size the biochemical
	activity exerted by the protein represented a dominant factor. More
	than one third of all biochemical activity classes were enriched
	in one or more size intervals. Conclusion: In yeast, there is an
	inverse relationship between protein size and protein expression
	such that highly expressed proteins tend to be of smaller size. Also,
	protein size is moderately affected by protein connectivity and strongly
	affected by biochemical activity. Phenotypic pleiotropy does not
	seem to affect protein size.},

	extent, of the maximum human life span; the increase in percentage
	of elderly in the population and in the proportion of the national
	expenditure utilized by the elderly) have stimulated and continue
	to expand the study of aging. Recently, the view of aging as an extremely
	complex multifactorial process has replaced the earlier search for
	a distinct cause such as a single gene or the decline of a key body
	system. This minireview keeps in mind the multiplicity of mechanisms
	regulating aging; examines them at the molecular, cellular, and systemic
	levels; and explores the possibility of interactions at these three
	levels. The heterogeneity of the aging phenotype among individuals
	of the same species and differences in longevity among species underline
	the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors in shaping
	the life span. Thus, the presence of several trajectories of the
	life span, from incidence of disease and disability to absence of
	pathology and persistence of function, suggest that it is possible
	to experimentally ( e. g., by calorie restriction) prolong functional
	plasticity and life span. In this minireview, several theories are
	identified only briefly; a few ( evolutionary, gene regulation, cellular
	senescence, free radical, and neuro-endocrineimmuno theories) are
	discussed in more detail, at molecular, cellular, and systemic levels.

  abstract = {Phenotypic mutations are errors that occur during protein synthesis.
	These errors lead to amino acid substitutions that give rise to abnormal
	proteins. Experiments suggest that such errors are quite common.
	We present a model to study the effect of phenotypic mutation rates
	on the amount of abnormal proteins in a cell. In our model, genes
	are regulated to synthesize a certain number of functional proteins.
	During this process, depending on the phenotypic mutation rate, abnormal
	proteins are generated. We use data on protein length and abundance
	in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to parametrize our model. We calculate
	that for small phenotypic mutation rates most abnormal proteins originate
	from highly expressed genes that are on average nearly twice as large
	as the average yeast protein. For phenotypic mutation rates much
	above 5 X 10(-4), the error-free synthesis of large proteins is nearly
	impossible and lowly expressed, very large proteins contribute more
	and more to the amount of abnormal proteins in a cell. This fact
	leads to a steep increase of the amount of abnormal proteins for
	phenotypic mutation rates above 5 X 10(-4). Simulations show that
	this property leads to an upper limit for the phenotypic mutation
	rate of approximately 2 X 10(-3) even if the costs for abnormal proteins
	are extremely low. We also consider the adaptation of individual
	proteins. Individual genes/proteins can decrease their phenotypic
	mutation rate by using preferred codons or by increasing their robustness
	against amino acid substitutions. We discuss the similarities and
	differences between the two mechanisms and show that they can only
	slow down but not prevent the rapid increase of the amount of abnormal
	proteins. Our work allows us to estimate the phenotypic mutation
	rate based on data on the fraction of abnormal proteins. For S. cerevisiae,
	we predict that the value for the phenotypic mutation rate is between
	2 X 10(-4) and 6 X 10(-4). },

  abstract = {Severe inbreeding depression is routinely observed in outcrossing
	species. If inbreeding load is due largely to deleterious alleles
	of large effect, such as recessive lethals or steriles, then most
	of it is expected to be purged during brief periods of inbreeding.
	In contrast, if inbreeding depression is due to the cumulative effects
	of many deleterious alleles of small effect, then it will be maintained
	in the face of periodic inbreeding. Whether or not inbreeding depression
	can be purged with inbreeding in the short term has important implications
	for the evolution of mating systems and the probability that a small
	population will go extinct. In this paper I evaluate the extent to
	which the tremendous inbreeding load in a primarily outcrossing population
	of the wildflower, Mimulus guttatus, is due to alleles of large effect.
	To do this, I first constructed a large outbred "ancestral" population
	by randomly mating plants collected as seeds from a natural population.
	From this population I formed 1200 lines that were maintained by
	self-fertilization and single seedling descent: after five generations
	of selfing, 335 lines had survived the inbreeding process. Selection
	during the line formation is expected to have largely purged alleles
	of large effect from the collection of highly inbred lines. Because
	alleles with minor effects on fitness should have been effectively
	neutral, the inbreeding depression due to this class of genes should
	have been unchanged. The inbred lines were intercrossed to form a
	large, outcrossed "purged" population. Finally, I estimated the fitness
	of outbred and selfed progeny from the ancestral and purged populations
	to determine the contribution of major deleterious alleles on inbreeding
	depression. I found that although the average fitness of the outcrossed
	progeny nearly doubled following purging, the limited decline in
	inbreeding depression and limited increase in inbred fitness indicates
	that alleles of large effect are not the principle cause of inbreeding
	depression in this population. In aggregate, the data suggest that
	lethals and steriles make a minority contribution to inbreeding depression
	and that the increased outbred fitness is due primarily to adaptation
	to greenhouse conditions.},

  journal = {Biology Direct},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {3},
  abstract = {Background: Proteins show a broad range of evolutionary rates. Understanding
	the factors that are responsible for the characteristic rate of evolution
	of a given protein arguably is one of the major goals of evolutionary
	biology. A long-standing general assumption used to be that the evolution
	rate is, primarily, determined by the specific functional constraints
	that affect the given protein. These constrains were traditionally
	thought to depend both on the specific features of the protein's
	structure and its biological role. The advent of systems biology
	brought about new types of data, such as expression level and protein-protein
	interactions, and unexpectedly, a variety of correlations between
	protein evolution rate and these variables have been observed. The
	strongest connections by far were repeatedly seen between protein
	sequence evolution rate and the expression level of the respective
	gene. It has been hypothesized that this link is due to the selection
	for the robustness of the protein structure to mistranslation-induced
	misfolding that is particularly important for highly expressed proteins
	and is the dominant determinant of the sequence evolution rate. Results:
	This work is an attempt to assess the relative contributions of protein
	domain structure and function, on the one hand, and expression level
	on the other hand, to the rate of sequence evolution. To this end,
	we performed a genome-wide analysis of the effect of the fusion of
	a pair of domains in multidomain proteins on the difference in the
	domain-specific evolutionary rates. The mistranslation-induced misfolding
	hypothesis would predict that, within multidomain proteins, fused
	domains, on average, should evolve at substantially closer rates
	than the same domains in different proteins because, within a mutlidomain
	protein, all domains are translated at the same rate. We performed
	a comprehensive comparison of the evolutionary rates of mammalian
	and plant protein domains that are either joined in multidomain proteins
	or contained in distinct proteins. Substantial homogenization of
	evolutionary rates in multidomain proteins was, indeed, observed
	in both animals and plants, although highly significant differences
	between domain-specific rates remained. The contributions of the
	translation rate, as determined by the effect of the fusion of a
	pair of domains within a multidomain protein, and intrinsic, domain-specific
	structural-functional constraints appear to be comparable in magnitude.
	Conclusion: Fusion of domains in a multidomain protein results in
	substantial homogenization of the domain-specific evolutionary rates
	but significant differences between domain-specific evolution rates
	remain. Thus, the rate of translation and intrinsic structural-functional
	constraints both exert sizable and comparable effects on sequence
	evolution. Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Sergei Maslov,

	organs such as lymph nodes until they are eventually activated by
	recognizing cognate peptide/MHC-complexes on the surface of antigen-presenting
	cells. The intranodal T cell migration behavior leading to these
	crucial - and potentially rare - encounters during the induction
	of an adaptive immune response could not be directly addressed until,
	in 2002, the use of two-photon microscopy also allowed the visualization
	of cellular dynamics deep within intact lymph nodes. Since then,
	numerous studies have confirmed that, by default, naive T cells are
	extremely motile, scanning the paracortical T cell zone for cognate
	antigen by means of an apparent random walk. This review attempts
	to summarize the current knowledge of factors influencing the basal

	steady state. Extracellular cues, such as the motility-promoting
	influence of CCR7 ligands and the role of integrins during interstitial

	T cell motility, will be discussed. Particular emphasis is placed
	on structural features of the lymph node environment orchestrating
	T cell migration, namely the network of fibroblastic reticular cells

	yielded quantitative results with reasonable accuracy when the six-protein

	quantification was sometimes compromised due to comigration or partial
	comigration of proteins. The iTRAQ method is more susceptible to
	errors in precursor ion isolation, which could be manifested with
	increasing sample complexity. The quantification sensitivity of each
	method was estimated by the number of peptides detected for each
	protein. In this regard, the global-tagging iTRAQ technique was more
	sensitive than the cysteine-specific cICAT method, which in turn
	was as sensitive as, if nol more sensitive than, the DIGE technique.
	Protein profiling on HCT-11 16 and HCT-116 p53 -/- cell lysales displayed

	via spontaneous deamination which occurs much more frequently on
	single-stranded than on double-stranded DNA. For the 12 coding sequences
	(CDS) collinear with the L-strand, NNY synonymous codon families
	(where N stands for any of the four nucleotides and Y stands for
	either C or U) end mostly with C, and NNR and NNN codon families

  volume = {8},
  abstract = {Background: Fungal and animal mitochondrial genomes typically have
	one {tRNA} for each synonymous codon family. The codon-anticodon
	adaptation hypothesis predicts that the wobble nucleotide of a {tRNA}
	anticodon should evolve towards maximizing Watson-Crick base pairing
	with the most frequently used codon within each synonymous codon
	family, whereas the wobble versatility hypothesis argues that the
	nucleotide at the wobble site should be occupied by a nucleotide
	most versatile in wobble pairing, i.e., the {tRNA} wobble nucleotide
	should be G for NNY codon families, and U for NNR and NNN codon families
	(where Y stands for C or U, R for A or G and N for any nucleotide).
	Results: We here integrate these two traditional hypotheses on {tRNA}
	anticodons into a unified model based on an analysis of the wobble
	costs associated with different wobble base pairs. This novel approach
	allows the relative cost of wobble pairing to be qualitatively evaluated.
	A comprehensive study of 36 fungal genomes suggests very different
	costs between two kinds of U: G wobble pairs, i.e., (1) between a
	G at the wobble site of a {tRNA} anticodon and a U at the third codon
	position (designated M-U3:G) and (2) between a U at the wobble site
	of a {tRNA} anticodon and a G at the third codon position (designated
	M-G3:U). Conclusion: In general, MU3: G is much smaller than MG3:
	U, suggesting no selection against U-ending codons in NNY codon families
	with a wobble G in the {tRNA} anticodon but strong selection against
	G-ending codons in NNR codon families with a wobble U at the {tRNA}
	anticodon. This finding resolves several puzzling observations in
	fungal genomics and corroborates previous studies showing that U3:G
	wobble is energetically more favorable than G3:U wobble. },

	rate of initiation depends on the encountering rate between ribosomes

	and {mRNA}. Thus, patterns of codon usage that increase transcriptional
	efficiency should increase {mRNA} concentration, which in turn would
	increase the initiation rate and the rate of protein synthesis. An
	optimality model of the transcriptional process is presented with
	the prediction that the most frequently used ribonucleotide at the

	abundant ribonucleotide in the cellular matrix where {mRNA} is transcribed.
	This prediction is supported by four kinds of evidence. First, A-ending
	codons are the most frequently used synonymous codons in mitochondria,
	where ATP is much more abundant than that of the three other ribonucleotides.
	Second, A-ending codons are more frequently used in mitochondrial

	partnerships to the incidence of HIV infection among homosexual men

	risky behaviours among both types of partners in the era of highly
	active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods: A mathematical model
	was developed for the spread of HIV infection among young homosexual
	men in Amsterdam after the introduction of HAART. The model describes
	the formation of both steady and casual partnerships. Behavioural
	parameters were estimated separately for steady and casual partners
	from the Amsterdam Cohort Study among young homosexual men. HIV incidence
	and the fraction of new infections attributed to casual contacts
	were calculated from the model, allowing for uncertainty in the increases
	in risky behaviour, the effect of HAART, and levels of HIV testing
	and HAART administration. Results: Currently, 86\% (range 74-90\%)
	of new HIV infections occur within steady partnerships. A reduction
	of 75-99\% in infectivity caused by HAART will be counterbalanced
	by increases of 50\% (range 30-80\%) in risky behaviour with steady
	partners, but not by increases of up to 100\% with casual partners.
	If HIV testing is increased from 42 to 80\% and HAART administration
	from 70 to 85\%, then even an increase of 100\% in risk-taking with
	steady partners will not outweigh the effect of HAART. Conclusion:
	Most new HIV infections among homosexual men in Amsterdam occur within
	steady relationships. Prevention measures should address risky behaviour,
	specifically with steady partners, and the promotion of HIV testing.

	A mathematical model describing HIV transmission among homosexual
	men was developed. In the model, men are involved in both steady
	and casual partnerships. Infectivity is higher during PHI than during
	chronic HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces
	infectivity and increases the time to the development of AIDS. Its
	effect is enhanced if treatment is initiated during PHI. HIV incidence
	and the fraction of transmission attributed to PHI were calculated
	for different levels of treatment efficacy. Results: Primary infections
	account for 35\% of HIV transmissions from casual partners and 6\%
	of transmissions from steady partners. Among all new infections,
	only 11\% occurs during PHI. Therefore, the effect of treatment during

	higher risky behaviour among casual partners, the fraction of transmission
	attributed to PHI increases to 25\%. Conclusion: Primary infections
	play a more important role in transmission from casual partners than
	in transmission from steady partners. Therefore, in communities in
	which steady partners account for the majority of new infections
	and the epidemic is at an advanced phase, the contribution of PHI

	rates and how these rates are integrated into cellular decisions.
	We decided to measure {mRNA} decay rates in two human cell lines

	of decay rates simultaneously for thousands of {mRNA} species. Using
	existing annotation and the Gene Ontology hierarchy of biological
	processes, we assign mRNAs to functional classes at various levels
	of resolution and compare the decay rate statistics between these
	classes. The results show statistically significant organizational
	principles in the variation of decay rates among functional classes.
	In particular, transcription factor mRNAs have increased average
	decay rates compared with other transcripts and are enriched in "fast-decaying"
	mRNAs with half-lives <2 h. In contrast, we find that mRNAs for biosynthetic
	proteins have decreased average decay rates and are deficient in
	fast-decaying mRNAs. Our analysis of data from a previously published
	study of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {mRNA} decay shows the same functional
	organization of decay rates, implying that it is a general organizational
	scheme for eukaryotes. Additionally, we investigated the dependence
	of decay rates on sequence composition, that is, the presence or
	absence of short {mRNA} motifs in various regions of the {mRNA} transcript.
	Our analysis recovers the positive correlation of {mRNA} decay with
	known AU-rich {mRNA} motifs, but we also uncover further short {mRNA}
	motifs that show statistically significant correlation with decay.
	However, we also note that none of these motifs are strong predictors
	of {mRNA} decay rate, indicating that the regulation of {mRNA} decay
	is more complex and may involve the cooperative binding of several
	{RNA}-binding proteins at different sites.},

	We have developed an algorithm to evaluate the relative rate of translation

	rate on the protein biogenesis. Using the complete genomes of Escherichia
	coli and Bacillus subtilis we show that stretches of codons pairing
	to minor {tRNA}s form putative sites to locally attenuate translation;
	thereby the tendency is to cluster in near proximity whereas long
	contiguous stretches of slow-translating triplets are avoided. The
	presence of slow-translating segments positively correlates with
	the protein length irrespective of the protein abundance. The slow-translating
	clusters are predominantly located down-stream of the domain boundaries
	presumably to fine-tune translational accuracy with the folding fidelity
	of multidomain proteins. Translation attenuation patterns at highly
	structurally and functionally conserved domains are preserved across
	the species suggesting a concerted selective pressure on the codon
	selection and species-specific {tRNA} abundance in these regions.},

	two chromosomes, the gene pairs were likely duplicated contemporaneously,

	insights into the distribution of nucleotide substitution rates among

	among the duplicated gene pairs, but 90\% of gene pairs differed
	by less than 2.6-fold. Average nonsynonymous rates were approximate

	and 0.44 for synonymous rates, indicating that synonymous and nonsynonymous
	rates vary among genes to roughly the same extent. The causes underlying
	rate variation were explored. Our analyses tentatively suggest an
	effect of physical location on synonymous substitution rates but
	no similar effect on nonsynonymous rates. Nonsynonymous substitution
	rates were negatively correlated with GC content at synonymous third
	codon positions, and synonymous substitution rates were negatively
	correlated with codon bias, as observed in other systems. Finally,
	the 242 gene pairs permitted investigation of the processes underlying

  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Background: Approximate methods for estimating nonsynonymous and synonymous
	substitution rates (Ka and Ks) among protein-coding sequences have
	adopted different mutation (substitution) models. In the past two
	decades, several methods have been proposed but they have not considered
	unequal transitional substitutions (between the two purines, A and
	G, or the two pyrimidines, T and C) that become apparent when sequences
	data to be compared are vast and significantly diverged. Results:
	We propose a new method (MYN), a modified version of the Yang-Nielsen
	algorithm (YN), for evolutionary analysis of protein-coding sequences
	in general. MYN adopts the Tamura-Nei Model that considers the difference
	among rates of transitional and transversional substitutions as well
	as factors in codon frequency bias. We evaluate the performance of
	MYN by comparing to other methods, especially to YN, and to show
	that MYN has minimal deviations when parameters vary within normal
	ranges defined by empirical data. Conclusion: Our comparative results
	deriving from consistency analysis, computer simulations and authentic
	datasets, indicate that ignoring unequal transitional rates may lead
	to serious biases and that MYN performs well in most of the tested
	cases. These results also suggest that acquisitions of reliable synonymous

	estimates of transition/transversion rate ratio. },

	these new technologies, DNA arrays have provided an important experimental
	approach for identifying changes in the levels of individual {mRNA}
	molecules during important cellular transitions. However, cellular
	behavior is dictated not by {mRNA} levels, but by the proteins translated
	from the individual {mRNA} species. We report a high-throughput method
	for simultaneously monitoring the translation state and level of
	individual {mRNA} species. Messenger RNAs from resting and mitogenically
	activated fibroblasts were separated, according to degree of ribosome
	loading, into well-translated and under-translated pools. cDNA probes
	generated from these fractions were used to interrogate cDNA arrays.
	Among approximately 1,200 genes analyzed, less than 1\% were found
	to be translationally regulated in response to mitogenic activation,
	demonstrating the strong selectivity of this regulatory mechanism.
	This high-throughput approach is shown to be an effective tool for
	superimposing translation profile on {mRNA} level for large numbers
	of genes, as well as for identifying translationally regulated genes
	for further study.},
